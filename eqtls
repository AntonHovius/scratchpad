  eQTLs
We identified 29 cis-eQTLs (p < 1.16 × 10−7, FDR <0.05) and 1 trans- eQTL (p < 4.06 × 10−11, FDR <0.05), independent of case/control status (Figure S3a; Table S1), when using 108 937 SNPs. Of the 30 eQTLs observed, there were 27 unique SNPs and 30 unique genes. The molecular functions and biological processes for each gene were identified using the UniProt database and are included in Table S2. The top 10 cis-eQTLs and 1 trans-eQTL are shown in Table 2.
The T allele of rs8521 was associated with an increase in expres- sion of both Transgelin (TAGLN) (p = 5.97 × 10−17, FDR = 2.58 × 10−11, β = 0.834) and SID1 Transmembrane Family Member 2 (SIDT2) (p = 6.18 × 10−10, FDR = 3.12 × 10−5, β = 0.301) (Figure 1a). The ex- pression of AC007278.2 and Interleukin 18 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL18RAP) were both associated with rs6758936 geno- type (p = 6.40 × 10−12, FDR = 1.14 × 10−6, β = 0.827; p = 8.45 × 10−12, FDR = 1.14 × 10−6, β = 0.751, respectively), whereby the presence of the A allele was associated with increased expression (Figure 1b). The presence of the C allele of rs933489 was associated with a decrease in expression of SMG Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay Factor (SMG5) (p = 1.06 × 10−11, FDR = 1.14 × 10−6, β = −0.267) and C1orf85 (p = 2.02 × 10−11, FDR = 1.74 × 10−6, β = −0.393) (Figure 1c). The eQTL effects of all 27 SNPs were verified in GTEx.
We did not identify significant local or distal SNP-gene pairs whose effects on expression differed according to case–control status (p > 1.16 × 10−7 and FDR >0.05) (Figure S3b). The five SNP- gene pairs with the smallest p-values obtained from Model 2, for both local and distal effects are listed in Table 3. SNPs rs1449562, rs210122 and rs4859211 are not known eQTLs to Diablo IAP- Binding Mitochondrial Protein (DIABLO), WDR46 and MCCC1, respec- tively (GTEx). However, several known eQTL effects, as observed in the GTEx database, were observed: rs1449562 have been associ- ated with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) and PSMB9 (whole blood) and RP11-347I19.7 and LINC01089 (brain); rs1449562 is associated with the expression of ITPR3 (whole blood) and
LINC00336 (brain); and rs4859211 is a known eQTL for ECE2 (brain). The remaining two top local SNPs, rs12075713 and rs7919939, are not known eQTLs in GTEx. Likewise, the top five distal SNPs are not known eQTLs to the respective genes nor do they appear in GTEx.
The relationship between the top three localSNP-gene pairs (rs1449562, rs210122 and rs4859211 and genes DIABLO, WDR46 and MCCC1, respectively) and top three distal SNP-gene pairs (rs2223335, rs56023619 and rs12829546 and SNRNP27, PRPF18 and PLEKHA8, respectively) in PTSD versus controls is depicted in Figure S4a–f. The molecular functions and biological processes of the six target genes are included in Table S3.
eQTL analysis using 5638 SNPs related to the PTSD PRS identified two significant cis-eQTLs (p < 2.25 × 10−6, FDR <0.05), independent of case/control status (Table 4). SNP rs11085906 (C > T) genotype was associated with the expression of ZNF333 (p = 6.84 × 10−7, FDR = 0.013, β = −0.20) and rs3774402 (A > G) was associated with the expression of ZBTB47 (p = 1.17 × 10−6, FDR = 0.013, β = −0.36) (Figure 2). These are known eQTL relationships in brain and whole blood tissue according to the GTEx database.
None of the interacting SNP-gene pairs survived multiple testing (p > 2.25 × 10−6, FDR >0.05). The top five smallest p-values obtained for both local and distal interacting SNPs are listed in Table 5. The top three local and distal interacting SNP-gene pairs are depicted in Figure S5a–f. Of these, rs4626538 is a known eQTL for RP11- 448A19.1 and rs7552428 has multiple eQTL effects on genes such as S100A13, RP1-178F15.4, S100A1, S100A2, SNAPIN, and S100A16.
Phenotypes associated with the identified eQTLs were inves- tigated using Open Target Genetics and are included in Figure S6. Only eQTL rs166329 was found to have been previously associated with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Form neuroticism item of “feeling tense” (Nagel et al., 2018) or to the ques- tions “Would you call yourself tense or ‘highly strung’” in the UK Biobank assessment (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank) Potential protein–protein interaction subnetworks were assessed through an indicator matrix constructed using the 30 eQTLs identified in- dependent of case/control status. One SNP-gene pair (rs6758936 - AC007278.2) was omitted from subsequent pathway enrichment analysis due to not having a corresponding entry in the BioGRID bio- logical network functioning as a reference. Exploratory models wereiteratively tested for every combination of K = [0–3] and L = [0–7], corresponding to approximately 10% of the number of eQTLs tested and the total number of study participants, respectively.
No notable interaction effects were observed between the gen- erated nodes provided during model construction, and the super- imposed biological pathways identified were largely self-contained. Although there was a minimal degree of inter-node connectivity in models developed using higher K parameters (reflective of the number of inactive nodes allowed during network assembly), these interactions were dependent on multiple nodes not present in our sample, rendering any findings entirely theoretical.
