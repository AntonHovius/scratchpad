Polygenic Risk Score of PTSD

significant loci were identified in the subset of samples of
European ancestry (n = 23,212 PTSD cases; n = 151,447
controls) and one significant locus was identified in the
subset of samples of African ancestry (n = 4,363 PTSD
cases; n = 10,976 controls) in the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2
GWAS (Nievergelt et al., 2019). The genome-wide significant
loci and variants in linkage disequilibrium implicated zinc
finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 14 (ZDHHC14), parkin
RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), kazrin (KAZN),
TMEM51 antisense RNA 1 (TMEM51-AS1) and zinc finger
protein 813 (ZNF813) in European samples and long intergenic
non-protein coding RNA 2335 (LINC02335), microRNA 5007
(MIR5007), PCBP2 overlapping transcript (PCBP2-OT1), long
intergenic non-protein coding RNA 2571 (LINC02571) and
major histocompatibility complex B (HLA-B) in African samples.
However, these did not replicate in an independent cohort
consisting of European- and African-American participants
(Gelernter et al., 2019) and to date, GWAS have yet to identify
robust genetic variants associated with PTSD.
This could be due to the fact that PTSD has a complex
genomic architecture, with potentially thousands to hundreds of
thousands of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
each with a small effect size, contributing to the risk for or
resilience against toward developing the disorder. Aggregating
the effects of these common SNPs, using individual or summary
level statistics from GWAS data, can provide insight into the
degree to which genetic variants influence the phenotype of
interest. For instance, at a population level, the phenotypic
variation observed in a cohort of women of European ancestry
with PTSD explained by common SNPs (h2 SNP ), was shown to be
∼ 29% (Duncan et al., 2018b). Interestingly, this was considerably
higher than the h2 SNP observed in the corresponding cohort
of male participants (Duncan et al., 2018b). Further, the SNPbased heritability estimates for PTSD are comparable to other
complex psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) (Duncan et al.,
2018b), highlighting the significant intrinsic contribution of
many common genetic variants toward the risk for PTSD.
To assess genetic liability at an individual level, one can
employ the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS). A PRS is the
sum of all the risk alleles carried by an individual weighted
by their effect size for a particular trait (Lewis and Vassos,
2020). In other words, PRS represent the additive effect of
thousands to hundreds of thousands of genetic variants as a
single measure of genetic risk, on an individual level, toward
developing a particular trait. Therefore, PRS has the potential
to identify individuals at risk for developing PTSD following
trauma exposure and in fact, the genetic risk for PTSD (PTSDPRS) has been shown to be more predictive of PTSD diagnosis
than trauma exposure severity (Waszczuk et al., 2020). The
predictive utility of PRS can also explain some of the phenotypic
variance in response to trauma exposure, for example, PTSDPRS explained 4.68% of the variation observed in PTSD onset
and 4.35% of PTSD symptom severity in a cohort of war
veterans (Misganaw et al., 2019). Delineating individuals based
on their PRS for developing PTSD may allow for improved
early prevention and treatment interventions to be put in place

rely on clinician-based interviews and self-report measures from
patients. There is a need to identify individuals at risk for
developing PTSD in order to implement early intervention
strategies or treatment following trauma exposure. However,
individual susceptibility, heterogenous symptoms and varying
degrees of trauma severity make predicting, diagnosing, and
treating PTSD challenging.
There are several risk factors associated with the development
of PTSD, such as level of education (Polimanti et al., 2019;
Shalev et al., 2019), the experience of childhood trauma (child
neglect and emotional, physical and sexual abuse) (McLaughlin
et al., 2017) and prior exposure to community and interpersonal
violence (Nöthling et al., 2019; Shalev et al., 2019). In
addition, females are more likely to develop PTSD than males
(Christiansen and Hansen, 2015). Further, PTSD is frequently
associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression (Barbano
et al., 2019) and often co-occurs with metabolic syndrome (MetS)
(Rosenbaum et al., 2015; Penninx and Lange, 2018). MetS, a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease, is characterized by obesity, high
blood pressure, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (Alberti et al.,
2009). Individuals with PTSD are at a greater risk for developing
MetS compared to age- and sex-matched controls (Rosenbaum
et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2017). The pathophysiology underlying
PTSD and its associated co-morbidities remain largely unknown.
Although PTSD is conditional upon an extrinsic event(s), there
is strong evidence to support the genetic heritability of PTSD
(Duncan et al., 2018a). It is, however, unclear how trauma
exposure and genetic risk interact to result in PTSD and MetS comorbidity. Therefore, understanding the genetic architecture of
PTSD may help elucidate the physiological mechanisms that lead
to the development of the disorder and help identify and treat
individuals at risk.
Candidate gene approaches have reported an association
between PTSD and variants in genes such as FKBP prolyl
isomerase 5 (FKBP5), ADCYAP receptor type I (ADCYAP1R1)
and C-reactive protein (CRP) (reviewed by Daskalakis et al.,
2018). Briefly, these genes implicate hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis dysfunction, glucocorticoid dysregulation, and
immune system abnormalities in PTSD. These associations are
supported by several other studies. For instance, increased hair
cortisol levels were observed in South African women with
PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls (Heuvel et al.,
2020) and PTSD severity has been associated with higher
levels of inflammation (Fonkoue et al., 2020). However, the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) (Sullivan et al., 2018)
have highlighted the power of genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), which simultaneously test the association of common
genetic variants across the genome with a phenotype of interest,
thereby limiting the usage and bias of candidate gene studies in
the field of psychiatric genetics.
The PGC-PTSD Workgroup, an international collaboration
investigating the genomics of PTSD, have published two of
the largest PTSD GWAS to date (Duncan et al., 2018b;
Nievergelt et al., 2019). The PGC-PTSD Freeze 1 dataset
(n = 4,522 PTSD cases; n = 15,548 controls) did not identify
any genome-wide significant loci (Duncan et al., 2018b).
However, after acquiring additional samples, two independent

disorder (e.g., severe psychotic or bipolar disorder), or any
neurological disorder.

following trauma or in anticipation of trauma exposure (e.g.,
emergency service personnel).
Polygenic risk scores can also be used to examine shared
genetic risk between traits of interest such as associated comorbidities (e.g., MetS) and other psychiatric disorders. For
example, a modest genetic risk overlap was observed between
PTSD and MDD (Duncan et al., 2018b) and MDD-PRS
significantly predicted PTSD diagnoses in a cohort of 9/11
responders (Waszczuk et al., 2020) as well as in a civilian Peruvian
cohort (Shen et al., 2020). Shared genetic risk strongly suggests
joint underlying genetic and physiological mechanisms exist
between traits and PRS can therefore also be used to identify
shared molecular pathways to provide insight into mechanisms
underlying co-morbid disorders.
The studies introduced above have mainly been conducted in
cohorts comprising samples of European ancestry, which has left
a significant gap in knowledge regarding the genetic contribution
to developing PTSD in individuals that are not of European
ancestry. For example, due to discrepant allele frequencies
between population groups, a risk variant may not be associated
with a trait of interest in one population group compared
to another. The differences in genomic architecture between
various ancestries also impacts the utility of PRS amongst
different ancestral groups (Misganaw et al., 2019). This highlights
the need for genetic studies consisting of individuals of nonEuropean ancestry in order to increase the diversity of psychiatric
genetics research so that genetic-based treatment/intervention
strategies and the clinical use of PRS can be beneficial to all
population groups.
This study, comprised of a civilian cohort of individuals selfidentified as belonging to the South African Colored population
group, examined cross-sectionally, aimed (i) to identify genetic
variants associated with PTSD by conducting a GWAS metaanalysis (n = 343 controls; n = 260 PTSD cases), (ii) to
determine the predictive utility of PRS for PTSD in this
South African cohort, (iii) in order to investigate shared genetic
mechanisms between PTSD and MetS. This study represents the
first GWAS and PRS analysis of PTSD in a uniquely admixed
South African sample.

Demographic and Clinical Assessment
Sociodemographic data, such as gender, ethnicity, age, education,
employment, income, and marital status, were ascertained
using a demographic questionnaire. Clinicians diagnosed
participants with PTSD, and assessed PTSD symptom severity
over the previous month, using the Clinician-Administered
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS-5) for Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)
(Weathers et al., 2015). In addition, PTSD symptom severity
(range 0–80) was also determined using the PTSD Checklist
for DSM-5 (PCL-5), with a cut-off point between 31 and
33 suggestive of probable PTSD diagnoses (Blevins et al.,
2015). Where possible, control participants were matched
on ethnicity, age, gender and trauma-exposure, based on
the DSM-5 criteria.
Metabolic syndrome screening was conducted using the WHO
STEPS instrument (WHO, 2008). Blood pressure, heart rate,
height, weight, and waist circumference were measured. In
addition, venous blood samples were drawn after an overnight
fast (of at least 8 h), to assess levels of fasting blood glucose,
triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).
Participants were diagnosed with MetS if they were found
to have three out of five of the following harmonized JIS
criteria: (i) raised waist circumference (≥90 cm); (ii) raised
triglycerides (>1.7 mmol/l); (iii) low HDL-C (men < 1.0 mmol/l,
women < 1.3 mmol/l); (iv) raised blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg
or on hypertension treatment; and (v) raised fasting glucose
≥5.6 mmol/l or on diabetes treatment. These criteria and cutoff values represent a widely used consensus definition of MetS
derived from a meeting of several health organizations (Alberti
et al., 2009). In addition, body mass index (BMI), an alternative
clinical measure of adiposity to asses MetS (Gurka et al., 2018),
was used as a continuous measure of cardiovascular disease risk
in the PRS models.

Genotype Quality Control and Imputation
DNA from participants with PTSD and controls was extracted
from blood samples using the Gentra Puregene Blood
Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacture’s protocol, in
the Neuropsychiatric Genetics Laboratory at Stellenbosch
University, South Africa. One-hundred and sixty-three of the
controls and 164 participants with PTSD were genotyped using
the Infinium Multi-ethnic Global Array (MEGA, Illumina)
(Wave 1) and 221 controls and 117 participants with PTSD
were genotyped using the Infinium Global Screening Array
(GSA, Illumina) (Wave 2). All genotyping was conducted at the
Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, United States) in collaboration
with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and Cohen Veteran
Society. Note, due to the complex genomic architecture
of the study population, a 5-way admixed population, the
samples genotyped through this collaboration were not
included in the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS meta-analysis
and therefore, the discovery and target datasets used for the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Participants for this study were recruited between May 2014
and June 2017 as part of the SHARED ROOTS project,
conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. The study was
approved by Stellenbosch University’s Health Research Ethics
Committee (HREC: N13/08/115). All research participants
provided written informed consent to take part in the
study. Participants were included if they were willing and
able to provide informed consent; were 18 years or older;
were able to read and write Afrikaans or English; were not
pregnant; and were self-identified as being South African
Colored. The South African Colored population is a fiveway admixed population group, located in the Western
Cape Province of South Africa (Uren et al., 2016, 2020).

Table 1). A fixed-effects meta-analysis was then conducted across
Wave 1 and Wave 2 using p-values and direction of effect,
weighted by sample size, in METAL (Willer et al., 2010). A pvalue below 5 × 10−8 was considered statistically significant,
according to Bonferroni multiple test correction for one million
SNPs. A SNP with a p-value below 5 × 10−6 was considered to be
suggestively associated with PTSD.

PRS analysis (see section “Polygenic Risk Score Analysis”)
are independent.
Genotyping quality control procedures were performed
separately on the genotype data obtained from Wave 1 and
Wave 2 samples using PLINK 1.9 (Chang et al., 2015). Briefly,
variants were restricted to SNPs located on chromosomes 1–
22 and were excluded if they had a minor allele frequency
(MAF) < 1%, a missingness rate >3%; a significantly different
call rate between cases and controls; or failed Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium in control samples (p-value < 1 × 10−6 ) (Schurz
et al., 2019). Individual samples were removed if they were found
to have excessive missingness, a mean heterozygosity rate greater
than three times the standard deviation, and mismatching sex
information (Marees et al., 2018). Related samples were identified
using the pairwise identity-by-descent function in PLINK 1.9 and
PI_HAT > 0.2 (Anderson et al., 2010; Marees et al., 2018). Thirtythree and 31 samples were removed due to relatedness in Wave 1
and Wave 2, respectively.
Genotype principal component analysis (PCA) of PTSD
cases and controls was performed using SMARTPCA
(Patterson et al., 2006; Price et al., 2006), after restricting
SNPs to variants with rsIDs only; removing SNPs in linkage
disequilibrium (–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.2); and removing
related individuals (PI_HAT > 0.2) (Anderson et al., 2010;
Marees et al., 2018). In addition, SMARTPCA was used to
show how the South African Colored population fits in among
global ancestral groups. This was done by merging these
genotype data with 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) Phase3 data
(Auton et al., 2015).
In order to increase coverage, genotype imputation was
conducted using SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al., 2011) and the
positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) (Durbin, 2014)
via the Sanger Imputation Server (McCarthy et al., 2016)
and the African Genome Resource (AGR) reference panel1 .
Supplementary Figure 1 illustrates that imputation with the
AGR reference panel produced higher median quality scores
compared to other available reference panels. The AGR has
previously been shown to be the most suitable, publicly available
imputation panel for the South African Colored population
(Schurz et al., 2019). Following imputation, SNPs with an INFO
Score > 0.8, a MAF > 1% and a missingness rate <3% were
retained for further analysis.

Functional Annotation
The GWAS meta-analysis output was annotated according to
the human genome build GRCh37 (hg19) using the default
settings of the SNP2GENE function in FUnctional Mapping and
Annotation (FUMA), a web-based tool (Watanabe et al., 2017).
SNPs were considered independent from each other at a default
r2 value of 0.6.

Polygenic Risk Score Analysis
PRSice version 2.3.1 (Choi and O’Reilly, 2019) was used to
calculate PTSD polygenic risk scores (PTSD-PRS) in Wave
1 and Wave 2 participants using summary statistics from
the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS dataset (Nievergelt et al.,
2019), available at https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/downloadresults/ptsd/, to assess whether PTSD-PRS was associated with
PTSD status and/or PTSD symptom severity, as measured
by CAPS-5 and PCL-5, MetS diagnosis (having at least
three out of five criteria) and BMI. PTSD-PRS analysis
was conducted using the overall PGC-PTSD Freeze-2 GWAS
summary statistics (ALL), as well as data from European(EURO) and African American- (AfAM) ancestry subsets in
order to determine which discovery dataset is best suited for this
study population.
In R (R Core Team, 2020), PTSD-PRS, at eight p-value
cut-off thresholds (PT1 = 0.001, PT2 = 0.05, PT3 = 0.1,
PT4 = 0.2, PT5 = 0.3, PT6 = 0.4, PT7 = 0.5 and PT8 = 1),
were regressed on the first five principal components in both
Wave 1 and Wave 2 participants. The phenotype of interest
was then regressed on the standardized, combined residuals.
The variance explained by the regression model was denoted
by Nagelkerke’s pseudo R2 value if the outcome variable was
binary (PTSD case/control status and MetS diagnosis) or R2 if
the outcome variable was continuous (PTSD symptom severity
score (CAPS-5 and PCL-5) and BMI) (Choi and O’Reilly, 2019).
A p-value of less than 0.00625 was determined as significant
according to Bonferroni multiple test correction (p < 0.05/8
p-value thresholds).

GWAS Meta-Analysis
Genome-wide association analysis was conducted following
quality control and imputation within Wave 1 (controls, n = 141;
PTSD, n = 153) and Wave 2 (controls, n = 202; PTSD, n = 107).
Logistic regression was performed to test the association between
genotype and PTSD diagnosis with the first five PCs included as
covariates (Supplementary Figure 2). Sex was not included as
a covariate because the number of male and female participants
did not differ between the case and control groups (χ2 , p > 0.05,
Table 1). However, age was included as an additional covariate
in the Wave 2 GWAS because control subjects were significantly
older than participants with PTSD in (Wilcoxon, p < 0.001,
1

Statistical Analysis
In order to determine differences between PTSD cases and
controls, within each Wave, non-parametric data (age,
CAPS-5 score, and PCL-5 score) were analyzed using a
Wilcoxon test and represented by the median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences in categorical variables (sex
and MetS diagnosis) between PTSD cases and controls were
analyzed using a Chi-squared (χ2 ) test. Statistical analysis
was conducted in R 4.0.2 or higher (R Core Team, 2020).
The package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) was used to generate
the figures in R.

The web-based tool FUMA, annotated the seven independent
lead SNPs of suggestive significance, to five genes: PARK2, CUB
and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1), dedicator of cytokinesis
(DOCK4), chromosome 3 open reading frame 80 (C3orf80),
and ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 8 (ABCA8)
(Table 2). Gene-based analysis further revealed PARK2 as a
genome-wide significant gene (p = 2.6473 × 10−6 ) out of a total
of 18,861 protein-coding genes. Gene-set analysis did not reveal
any pathways significantly associated with PTSD.

RESULTS
Study Population Description
One-hundred and forty-one controls and 153 participants with
PTSD remained after 33 samples were excluded from the
Wave 1 dataset due to relatedness estimates determined during
genotype data quality control procedures. Similarly, 31 samples
were excluded from the Wave 2 dataset due to relatedness
which left 202 controls and 107 participants with PTSD for
association analysis.
Within the Wave 1 dataset, controls were of similar age
to PTSD participants. Participants with PTSD did not differ
from controls on BMI. Both PTSD and control groups had a
similar proportion of female participants as well as a similar
number of participants with a MetS diagnosis (Table 1). Wave
2 controls were significantly older than participants with PTSD
(Wilcoxon, p < 0.001, Table 1). There were no significant
differences in BMI, sex and MetS frequency between PTSD cases
and controls in Wave 2.
All participants were self-identified as belonging to
the South African Colored population group. The genetic
distribution of this population within the global ancestry groups
is illustrated by Figure 1. The South African Colored population
group cluster separately from the other global population groups
based on their genetic data. Supplementary Figure 2 illustrates
that participants with PTSD and controls were evenly distributed
across the principal components.

Polygenic Risk Score Analysis
Posttraumatic stress disorder-polygenic risk scores were
calculated in Wave 1 and Wave 2 participants (controls n = 343;
PTSD, n = 260) using the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary
statistics (ALL, overall; EURO, European-ancestry; and AfAM,
African American-ancestry) to assess whether PTSD-PRS was
associated with PTSD status, PTSD symptom severity and MetSrelated phenotypes in this South African sample. Regression
analysis obtained the lowest p-value at PT2−ALL = 0.05 using the
overall (ALL) PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics
(p = 0.00786). This explained 1.31% of the PTSD case/control
phenotypic variation, as measured by Nagelkerke’s pseudo R2
value (Figure 3). Likewise, regression analysis for CAPS-5 total
scores obtained a p-value of 0.036 at PT2−ALL = 0.05, which
explained 0.86% of the phenotypic variation in CAPS-5 total
scores (Figure 3). PTSD-PRS was associated with PCL-5 score
(PT2−EURO = 0.05, R2 = 0.00737, p = 0.0353, Figure 3); and MetS
diagnosis (PT1−EURO = 0.001, Nagelkerke’s pseudo R2 = 0.00969,
p = 0.0217, Figure 4) when using the European PGC-PTSD
Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics. However, these results
were not significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing (Bonferroni corrected p-value = 0.00625). Further,
PTSD-PRS calculated using the African American (AfAM)
PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics (Figures 3, 4)
was not associated with any of the phenotypes of interest (PTSD
diagnosis, PTSD symptom severity, MetS diagnosis, and BMI).

GWAS Meta-Analysis
Six-hundred and three samples were included in the metaanalysis. No SNPs reached genome wide significance
(p < 5 × 10−8 , Figure 2A). However, seven independent
loci reached a suggestive level of significance (p < 5 × 10−6 ,
Figure 2A and Table 2): rs2315551 (chr6, p = 2.262 × 10−7 ),
rs9458519 (chr6, p = 3.212 × 10−7 ), rs58910976 (chr8,
p = 1.388 × 10−6 ), rs2084346 (chr11, p = 2.202 × 10−6 ),
rs1419748 (chr7, p = 3.178 × 10−6 ), rs6791269 (chr3,
p = 3.884 × 10−6 ) and rs77235638 (chr17, p = 4.006 × 10−7 ),
with a consistent direction of effect between the two datasets.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first GWAS and PRS
analysis of PTSD in the South African population. Despite the

modest sample size (n = 603), the results of the GWAS metaanalysis suggest that variants in PARK2 may be associated with
the development of PTSD, which is in agreement with the largest
PTSD-GWAS meta-analysis conducted to date (Nievergelt et al.,
2019). In addition, PRS indicate a possible role of PTSDassociated genetic risk in PTSD-MetS comorbidity, despite
the discovery datasets being mostly made up of samples of
European ancestry.

The seven independent lead SNPs of suggestive evidence for
association (p-value below 5 × 10−6 ) in the GWAS meta-analysis,
implicated five genes in the development of PTSD (PARK2,
CSMD1, DOCK4, C3orf80, and ABCA8). Briefly, variants in
CSMD1, encoding the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1
protein, have previously been associated with PTSD following
combat exposure in participants from the Marine Resiliency
Study, with 85% of the participants being of European ancestry

(Nievergelt et al., 2015). Further, CSMD1 has also been implicated
in schizophrenia (The Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide
Association Study Consortium, 2011), bipolar disorder (Woo
et al., 2017) and cognitive function (Norwegian/Scandinavian
cohort) (Athanasiu et al., 2017). CSMD1 plays a role in
the complement system which is involved in the immune
system but also in synaptic pruning, a crucial mechanism
in neurodevelopment and cognitive processes (Stephan et al.,
2012). DOCK4 has been implicated in schizophrenia and autism
spectrum disorder (Koomar and Michaelson, 2020). DOCK4
regulates adherens junctions between cells and plays a role
in dendritic growth, neurodevelopmental processes as well as
neurotransmission (Ueda et al., 2008).
Of significance interest is the suggestive association between
variants in the PARK2 gene (also known as PRKN) and PTSD
in this South African cohort, because PARK2 has previously
been associated with PTSD in the largest PTSD-GWAS metaanalysis conducted to date (Nievergelt et al., 2019). PARK2
encodes parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in many cellular
processes throughout the human body. For reasons yet to be
fully understood, although evidence points to mitochondrial
dysfunction, loss of function associated with variants within
PARK2 results in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons,
specifically (Shaltouki et al., 2015; Sassone et al., 2017; Noda
et al., 2020). Hence, PARK2 genetic variation has been found
to be associated with decreased levels of dopamine and the
development of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Blauwendraat et al.,
2020). It is notable that war veterans with PTSD are found to
have increased risk of developing PD compared to matchedcontrols (White et al., 2020). Moreover, symptoms of PTSD, such
as intrusive (re-experiencing) thoughts, avoidance behaviors,
hyperarousal and negative alterations in cognition and mood can
be explained by a deficit in dopaminergic signaling in the brain
(reviewed by Torrisi et al., 2019) and may unite various PTSD
comorbidities, such as MDD (Ney et al., 2021). Therefore, it is
plausible that genetic variation in PARK2 contributes to deficits
in dopaminergic signaling observed in the pathophysiology of
PTSD. Importantly, even though results from this study are in
line with existing literature, before conclusions can be drawn,
further work is needed to validate these findings.
Results from the PRS analysis demonstrated that PTSDPRS constructed from the overall PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS
summary statistics was associated with a diagnosis of PTSD in
this South African population. Further, PTSD-PRS was associated
with MetS diagnosis, but not BMI, when using a subset of PGCPTSD Freeze 2 that only consisted of data from individuals of
European-ancestry. This finding supports the well-documented
association between PTSD and MetS, suggesting that the genetic
variants involved in the development of PTSD also play a role
in the development of MetS. This may provide insight into
mechanisms underlying PTSD-MetS comorbidity.
Results from the PRS analysis need to be considered with
caution because the PTSD-PRS only explains a small proportion
of the observed phenotypic variation (<2%) in PTSD and MetS
and, further, the significant findings do not withstand correction
for multiple testing. This may be because the use of PRS is
less applicable in non-European populations due to the current

Polygenic Risk Score of PTSD

FIGURE 3 | PTSD-PRS prediction for PTSD-related phenotypes (PTSD case/control status, CAPS-5 score and PCL-5 score). The lowest p-value was obtained at
PT2−ALL = 0.05 using the overall (ALL) PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics (p = 0.00786). This explained 1.31% of the PTSD case/control phenotypic
variation. However, PTSD-PRS, calculated using the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics, was not predictive of PTSD or PTSD symptom severity after
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p > 0.00625). CAPS-5, clinician-administered PTSD symptom for DSM-5; PCL-5, PTSD checklist for DSM-5; ALL, overall

FIGURE 4 | PTSD-PRS prediction for metabolic syndrome-related phenotypes. The lowest p-value was obtained at PT1−EURO = 0.001 using the European (EURO)
PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS summary statistics (p = 0.0217). This explained 0.97% of the variation in MetS diagnosis. Results were not significant after Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing (p > 0.00625). MetS, metabolic syndrome diagnosis; BMI, body mass index; ALL, overall PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 data; EURO, European

In summary, results from this study provide supporting
evidence for the role of genetic variation in PARK2 in the
development of PTSD. Results from the PRS analysis suggest
that genetic risk variants associated with PTSD are also involved
in the etiology of MetS thereby providing insight into PTSDMetS comorbidity. Examining the genomic data in conjunction
with additional omics data such as gene expression data and
epigenetic data will facilitate increased confidence in the findings.
Nonetheless, the study and findings contribute to the broader
goal of increasing diversity in psychiatric genetics.

lack of large available GWAS summary statistics from cohorts
of non-European or admixed ancestry that can be used as
discovery data (Vassos et al., 2017). PRS analysis performs better
when the discovery and target datasets are derived from the
same ancestral population (Misganaw et al., 2019). For example,
using the PGC-PTSD Freeze 1 summary statistics, the PTSDPRS explained 4.68% of the phenotypic variation in a cohort
of European veterans, but the predictive ability of the same
PRS was minimal in a sub-set of veterans of African ancestry
(Misganaw et al., 2019).
Currently, the PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS overall summary
statistics are the largest discovery dataset available to calculate
PTSD-PRS (n = 206,655 participants). However, it may not be
the most optimal discovery dataset to calculate PTSD-PRS in
individuals belonging to the South African Colored population,
even with the option to stratify the discovery dataset by ancestry
because the resultant subsets are much smaller in sample
size. This may explain why the PTSD-PRS calculated using
the African American (n ∼ 15,000 participants) subset of the
PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 GWAS was not predictive of any of the
phenotypes of interest.
In addition, ancestral make-up between the discovery and
target datasets is suggested to be a major PRS performance
indicator (Misganaw et al., 2019). Therefore, utilizing the overall
summary statistics probably produced the lowest p-value because
the dataset consists of genetic data from multiple ancestry
groups, similar to the varying ancestral contributions to the
South African Colored genome (Uren et al., 2016, 2020).
However, this does not explain why we only observed an
association between PTSD-PRS and MetS diagnosis when using
the European subset of PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 summary statistics.
As the psychiatric genetics field slowly diversifies its studies,
or develops alternative techniques better suited for admixed
populations and populations of non-European ancestry, PRS
analysis and predictive performance in non-European cohorts
should improve, thereby strengthening the statistical as well as
clinical applicability of PRS across the globe.
While this study has yielded important preliminary findings,
there are limitations that deserve mention. First, this study
was considerably underpowered, with a total of n = 603
participants included in the final meta-analysis, and neither
GWAS nor PRS results withstood correction for multiple
testing. Results from this study require replication in more
powerful datasets. Second, statistical genetic tools and the
GWAS and PRS approaches used in the current study may
not be appropriate for the complex genetic architecture of
the South African Colored population, corroborating the
call for analytical pipelines that are designed specifically to
handle genomic data of complex admixed populations as
well as the need to increase the diversity of the psychiatric
genetics field to facilitate accuracy and clinical application of
underlying genetic risk measures. Lastly, with larger samples,
future work should consider analyzing PTSD and MetS by
symptom clusters (i.e., applying a dimensional approach) rather
than categorically by diagnosis in order to provide insight
into the mechanisms underlying the heterogenous symptoms
characteristic of each disorder.
