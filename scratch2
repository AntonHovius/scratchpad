Introduction

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder  caused  by  mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes for ﬁbrillin-1  protein,  an important  constituent  of the  extracellular  matrix.  Although  these patients have a multisystemic disease that involves ocular, skeletal, and  cardiovascular  systems,  survival  is mainly determined by aortic complications. The current management of aortic involvement  in  MFS includes regular aortic imaging to evaluate aortic dilation progression, and prophylactic aortic repair when  aortic  dilation  reaches  a  deﬁned threshold that carries the threat of dissection (1). Current medical treatment aims to delay aortic dilation progression and avoid aortic complications, and betablockers are the standard treatment for preventing aortic dilation. However, the randomized evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers is limited to a single, small, open-label trial (2), and many patients experience  progressive  aortic  dilation  despite  such therapy (3,4). Furthermore, aortic dilation in MFS has been related to overexpression of transforming growth factor–beta (5). Therefore, losartan, an  angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) that has previously demonstrated transforming growth factor–beta antagonism, has been studied. Four large clinical  trials  with  different  designs,  either comparing losartan with beta-blockers (6,7) or adding losartan or placebo to baseline treatment (8,9), included Marfan patients  with  different  age range  and aortic  dilation  proﬁles.  Results  at  3  years of follow-up ranged from reduction of aortic dilation from losartan treatment to no  beneﬁt  of  losartan added to baseline treatment (most of them with baseline  beta-blockers).  In  the  LOAT  (LOsartan vs ATenolol) trial (7), similar to The  Pediatric  Heart Network trial (6), no differences in aortic diameter progression were observed with losartan compared with  atenolol  treatment.  The  conﬂicting  results of the published studies raised the question of whether longer intervention would yield different results. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to eval- uate the beneﬁt of  losartan  compared  with  atenolol for  the  prevention  of  aortic  dilation  and  aortic  complications in Marfan patients over a longer period of observation (>5 years).

Methods

The MFS patients  included  in  the  previous  clinical trial (7) were followed-up over an open-label extension of the study, maintaining the initial treatment assigned by randomization. The follow-up protocol included a minimum of an annual clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. Clinical events (need  for aortic surgery based on Guidelines recommendations [1], aortic dissection, and/or death) were registered and, after at least 5 years had elapsed from the start of the clinical trial, a cardiac magnetic  resonance  imaging (CMR) study was performed. The study was approved by the ethics committees of both hospitals, and all patients (or their guardians) provided their written informed consent.
PARTICIPANTS. The initial inclusion criteria for participation  in  the  LOAT  trial  were:  MFS  diagnosis (based on original Ghent criteria), age between 5 and 60 years, and maximum aortic root diameter <45 mm. Exclusion criteria were: history of aortic dissection or
cardiac/aortic  surgery; grade III/IV aortic regurgitation; history of angioedema or any  other intolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARB, or beta-blockers; treatment with other cardiovascular drugs; pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or history  of asthma,  respiratory  failure,  kidney,  or neurological disease.  A  total  of 140 participants were included in the LOAT trial.  In  the  present  study,  12  patients  were ruled  out:  5  who  withdrew  consent, 1 for hypertension,  2  for  planned  pregnancy,  and 2 for noncompliance within 6 months of the start of  the  trial (Figure 1), and 2 in whom Marfan diagnosis  was  posteriorly ruled out. Thus, 128 patients were included for the  extension  of  the  trial  (n  ¼  64  losartan  group, n ¼ 64 atenolol group).

TREATMENT

Patients were maintained on the same drug (losartan or atenolol) and at the same dosage as during the clinical trial. Treatment was interrupted if pregnancy was planned (for losartan) or signs  of clinical  intolerance  (hypotension  or  asthenia)  or other side effects associated with the treatment CMR STUDY. The CMR study was performed with the same protocol as in the LOAT trial. All CMR  studies were conducted with 1.5-T (Signa Excite GE, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and 3-T systems (Philips Achieva Tx, Best, the Netherlands). Imaging of the entire aorta was obtained: steady-state free precession cine acquisitions were obtained in held expiration and with electrocardiography synchronization. Perpendicular cine images were obtained at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta (at the level of the pulmonary bifurcation) using the double-oblique technique.  The  3 cusp-to-commissure diameters were measured at the aortic root level at the enddiastolic frame. The maximum of the 3 diameters at baseline and at follow-up was considered for analysis. Maximum ascending aortic diameter was  also measured. All measurements were indexed by body surface area at the time of the CMR study. Measurements were taken by a blinded observer (N.V.) using the QFlow software package, version  5.5  (Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands).

OUTCOMES

As in the previous LOAT trial, primary endpoints were deﬁned as changes in aortic root and ascending aorta diameter indexed by body surface
area on CMR with losartan versus atenolol. Secondary endpoints were clinical events during follow-up, including aortic dissection, need for aortic  intervention or heart surgery, and death.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Analyses were made following the modiﬁed intention-to-treat principle. Continuous variables were summarized as mean  SD or median and  interquartile  range.  Categorical  variables  were  presented  as  counts  and  percentages. Comparison of continuous variables was made by Student’s t-test and by chi-square test for categorical variables. When normality was not assumed, nonparametric analyses were made instead. Survival curves  were  estimated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier method  and  compared  with  log-rank  tests.  Statistical signiﬁcance was considered at p #0.05 (2-sided). Analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  19.0  software (IBM,  Chicago,  Illinois).

RESULTS

A total of 128 patients were included in the  study:  64 from the  losartan  group  and  64  from  the  atenolol group. Baseline characteristics are  described  in Table 1. No differences were  observed  related  to  age, sex, body surface area, or aortic dimensions.  A  total  of 109 (85%) patients had FBN1 gene analysis, of whom a pathogenic mutation was found in 89 (82%): 50 (56%) were classiﬁed as dominant negative, 26 (29%) as haploinsufﬁcient, and 13 (15%) as unclassiﬁable. In the  losartan  group,  54  patients (84.4%) continued with losartan throughout follow-up; of the rest, 4 discontinued medical treatment, 5 changed to betablockers,  and  1  received  a  combination of atenolol plus losartan (due to hypertension).  A  total  of  48 patients (75.0%) in the atenolol group continued with atenolol throughout follow-up; 12 of the remaining patients  discontinued  medical  treatment, and 4 changed to losartan. Mean clinical follow-up was 6.7  1.5 years (median 7.2 years; interquartile range: 6.3 to 7.8 years). Nine events occurred in the losartan group (7  elective ascending aorta surgery, 1 elective descending aorta surgery, and 1 type A aortic dissection) and 12 in the atenolol group (9 elective  ascending  aorta  surgery,  2 type A aortic dissection,  and  1  type  B  aortic  dissection). Aortic root diameters prior to type A dissections were 43, 47, and 49 mm. Of the 4 aortic dissections, 3 resulted in death (1  type  B).  Survival  analysis  showed no differences in the combined  endpoint  of  aortic surgery, aortic dissection, or  death  (p  ¼ 0.462)  or  for the combined endpoint of  acute  aortic  syndrome  or death (p ¼ 0.305). Survival curves are shown in the Central Illustration.
 
total  of 61  patients  from the losartan group and 58 from the atenolol group had follow-up CMR, either at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up or before the event.  Mean CMR  follow-up  was  5.9 2.0  years. Aortic root diameter increased in both groups:
0.4	mm/year  (95%  conﬁdence  interval  [CI]:  0.2  to
0.5	mm/year)  in  the  losartan  and  0.4  mm/year  (95%
CI: 0.3 to 0.6 mm/year) in the atenolol groups. However, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in aortic dilation  progression  were  observed  between
groups: —0.0 mm/year (95% CI: —0.25 to 0.17 mm/year; p ¼ 0.754). Furthermore, no statistically signiﬁcant differences  were  observed  when  evaluating  aortic  root
diameters indexed by body surface area or  ascending aorta diameters (Table 2). Similar results were found when only patients who continued with the same treatment  as during the trial were considered (Online Table 1).
In  the  subgroup  analyses,  no  signiﬁcant  beneﬁcial
effect of losartan was observed on aortic root  diameter regardless of sex, age group, baseline aortic root diameter,  or  type  of  dominant  negative  versus  hap-
loinsufﬁcient  FBN1  mutation  (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION

 

This is the longest study to date comparing clinical evolution and aortic dilation in Marfan patients treated with atenolol  versus  losartan.  This  study found no differences in clinical events over a  long period of treatment (median: 7.2 years) or in aortic dilation progression assessed by CMR (median 6.7  years).  Furthermore,  no  differences  were observed in the subgroup analysis by sex,  age,  baseline aortic diameters, or type of FBN1 mutation.
Beta-blockers have become standard in the prevention  of  aortic  dilation  and  dissection  in  patients with MFS since the report by Shores  et  al.  (2). However, their beneﬁt is debatable, and 2 metaanalyses  also  reached  opposing  conclusions  (10,11). More recently, 4 prospective  randomized  trials, COMPARE (COzaar in Marfan  PAtients  Reduces aortic Enlargement) (8), Pediatric Heart Network (6), SARTAN  (Marfan  Sartan)  (9),  and  LOAT  (7),  were  the ﬁrst to examine the use of ARBs in Marfan patients; these trials followed the publication of the landmark work by Habashi et al. (12), in a mouse model, and the remarkably positive results of a  small,  nonrandomized trial on the effects of losartan in a small subset of children with a severe phenotype of the disease (3). The designs of these recent trials were diverse:  the  COMPARE  and  SARTAN  trials  assessed the  beneﬁt  of  adding  losartan  to  baseline  therapy compared with adding  placebo,  and  the  Pediatric Heart  Network  and  LOAT  trials  compared  the administration of losartan versus atenolol. The COMPARE was open-label, Pediatric  Heart  Network was single-blinded, and SARTAN and LOAT were double-blinded, randomized trials. Evaluation of the primary outcome, the rate of aortic root enlargement, was evaluated by echocardiography in the largest trials, the Pediatric Heart Network and SARTAN, and by CMR in the COMPARE and LOAT trials. Although COMPARE included only adult patients, 28% and 40%
of patients in the  SARTAN  and  LOAT  trials,  respectively, were <18 years of age. By contrast, 75% of patients in the Pediatric Heart Network were  <16  years, and the mean Z-score of included patients ranged from 3.2 to 4.0. Clinical events were similar between treatment groups, and  only  the  COMPARE  trial showed a slight reduction in aortic root growth rate at 3 years  in  the  group  treated  with  losartan  (0.77  
1.36 mm vs. 1.35 1.55 mm; p < 0.014). No relationship was found between blood pressure changes during treatment and aortic root growth rate  changes. Recently, a meta-analysis was published of all prospective randomized clinical trials studying the effect of losartan on aortic dilation (13). The results indicate that losartan treatment  slows the rate of aortic  dilation; however, no beneﬁts on clinical outcomes were
observed in the losartan group compared with the nonlosartan group (most under beta-blocker treatment). This result, however,  should  be  interpreted with caution: as previously exposed, the design of the 6 studies differed signiﬁcantly, and the meta-analysis
included redundant information of subgroup  analyses of the COMPARE trial. Furthermore, the relatively low dose of losartan administered in  human  trials compared with the mouse model could be an explanation for the lack of consistent positive results in human. However, one of the questions that remains to be answered is whether a longer intervention would yield different results. This question  is  partly addressed in the current study, where most patients maintained  the  baseline  randomized  treatment  and its doses, and after a 6-year treatment, we found no difference between losartan and atenolol treatment groups in the aortic root  dilation  rate  or  clinical events.  In  addition,  we  found  no  differences  in  losartan  efﬁcacy depending  on  the  type  of  FBN1  mutation,  thus  not  replicating  the  results from Franken et al. (14), which demonstrated a more marked reduction of aortic dilation rate with the addition of losartan in haploinsufﬁcient Marfan patients.

STUDY LIMITATIONS

Although the initial trial was double-blinded, the extension was open-label. However, experts who measured aorta size by CMR were blinded to the medical treatment and clinical information. A further limitation was the absence of  a control  group  with  placebo,  which  was  not  possible for  ethical  reasons  because  beta-blockers  are accepted as the standard treatment. The ﬁnal sample size of the study was not large; however, with the use of CMR for aortic diameter measurements, it sufﬁced to detect clinically signiﬁcant differences of 2 mm in 6 years in the aortic root dilation rate between  treatment groups (97% statistical power to detect a difference $0.4 mm/year). In the current study, 85%
of patients underwent FBN1  gene  analysis,  82%  of whom had pathogenic mutations. The proportion of negative  FBN1  in  our  study  (18%)  was  similar to other  clinical  trials:  15%  in  the SARTAN, 16.2% in the COMPARE, and 11.7%  in  the  Pediatric  Heart Network.

CONCLUSIONS

The results showed no differences in long-term treatment with  losartan  compared  to  atenolol  in aortic root and ascending aorta dilation rate or the frequency  of  clinical  events  in  MFS patients. Although losartan was not proven superior to atenolol in monotherapy in MFS patients, it might be a useful, low-risk alternative to beta-blockers in the long-term management of these patients.
