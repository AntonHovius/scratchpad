The chromatin regulatory landscape plays a critical role in many disease processes and embryo development.
Epigenome sequencing technologies such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) have enabled us to dissect the pangenomic regulatory landscape of cells and tissues in both time and space dimensions by detecting specific
chromatin state and its corresponding transcription factors. Pioneered by the advancement of chromatin
immunoprecipitation-chip (ChIP-chip) technology, abundant epigenome profiling technologies have become
available such as ChIP-seq, DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), ATAC-seq and so on. The advent of
single-cell sequencing has revolutionized the next-generation sequencing, applications in single-cell epigenetics are
enriched rapidly. Epigenome sequencing technologies have evolved from low-throughput to high-throughput and
from bulk sample to the single-cell scope, which unprecedentedly benefits scientists to interpret life from different
angles. In this review, after briefly introducing the background knowledge of epigenome biology, we discuss the
development of epigenome sequencing technologies, especially ChIP-seq & ATAC-seq and their current
applications in scientific research. Finally, we provide insights into future applications and challenges.
