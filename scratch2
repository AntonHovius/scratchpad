INTRODUCTION
The genome is packaged by histone proteins that are decorated with a wide variety of modifications. Histone acetylation is one of the best-characterized chromatin modifications and correlates with the opening of local chromatin structures and transcriptional activation (e.g., H3K27ac correlates with enhancers). Compared with histone acetylation, histone methylation is more diverse in terms of both functions and forms. Histone methylation includes H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36, H3K79, etc. Specific methylation of lysines can exist as monomethylation, dimethylation, or trimethylation with different functions.

Repressive histone methylation, such as H3K9me3, is highly associated with condensed and constitutive heterochromatin. Meanwhile, active histone methylation such as H3K4me3 contributes to active transcription. Several studies even revealed a class of bivalent chromatin with both active and repressive features, which exhibits overlapping patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. The discovery of the bivalent signature of such poised genes was unexpected and very important. For instance, it can be a critical landmark in the maternal-to-zygotic transition process, providing the first clues about the “intermediate” state. Also, bivalent chromatin is not specific to embryonic stem cells and has been well documented in other cell types. In more complex cases, elements that behave as promoters in some tissues can act as enhancers in other tissues, called cREDS (cis-regulatory elements with dynamic signatures), and the same regulatory elements can have both promoter and enhancer signatures.

More histone modifications also include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and ADP ribosylation. The current exploration of histone modifications still has the following problems:

Modifications on histone surfaces are often dynamic: some modifications can be added and erased in just a few minutes after a cell has been stimulated, so that the histone modifications detected in a population of cells under specific conditions at a given moment are in fact only partially representative of the types of potential modifications.
Antibodies to detect histone modifications are essential for many epigenetic chromatin sequencing techniques: in ChIP-seq, for example, antibody specificity testing is required for both histones and transcription factors.
The mechanisms of heterochromatin formation and diffusion, and the “memory” and “fading” of histone modifications, have been studied only to a minimal extent.
The concept of histone code cannot be widely used to accurately describe and predict a specific biological phenomenon in many cases.
Some histone modifications are active in some genomic regions. In contrast, repressive in others: for example, methylation of the H3K9 locus can be repressive in the promoter region and active in the coding region.

In contrast to single histone modifications, the chromatin regulatory landscape is a higher-level annotation on the biological function of chromatin that combines histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and the regulatory function of genomic elements. The renowned Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium has led large-scale human reference epigenomic studies that have provided detailed and accurate descriptions and classifications of the functional states of regulatory elements. In addition, by combining these chromatin epigenomic states with existing genome-wide methylation information and gene expression profiles from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), scientists can interpret the tissue-specific epigenomic landscape from a multi-dimensional perspective.

Many studies of chromatin dynamics require, besides access to information on histone modifications and genomic regulatory elements, a proper understanding of the interactions between transcription factors and chromatin, which is often essential for understanding development and disease progression. Some transcription factors binding to chromatin regulatory regions require specific histone modifications, while others require the assistance of open chromatin and other activators. Binding of some transcription factors to the regulatory regions facilitates the recruitment of additional transcription factors. It may promote the diffusion of chromatin status, which in turn further influences transcription factor binding. The in-depth research on the interaction mechanism is still limited. Recent research has explored epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by constructing synthetic read-write modules, which will help us better understand the basic principles of epigenetic inheritance.
