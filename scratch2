But if you take a look on the feature A, the amount of intronic
as well as intergenic reads from the combination is much higher. In the feature B, you can see that
all transcript we found in the isolate, in the well-established isolate, were found even in the
combination. And much more, especially long-known coding RNAs, were found in the combination. And
in feature C, you can see an RNA biotyping from both technologies. And even you, I showed you
in the slide before that the performances of isolate in terms of coding RNAs in comparison
with the techniques is excellent. But you can see here that when you compare the combination,
we are able to assess much more long-known coding RNAs that are working with the isolate alone.
Okay. Technically, we can say that the combination is working really fine and that the
overlap between well-established technologies, such as the isolate, is the performances of the
combination is working really fine. Now, we are coming much more in terms of biological evaluation.
And the first thing we did is, of course, this is a very common data analysis, nothing special,
because we proceed with data visualization, how we would classroom the patients in the UMAP from
the combination and the isolate alone. In panel B, you can see a top-handed markers or genes found
through the whole progeria samples, because in this disease, you will find many, many genes
that are differentially expressed that are common or associated directly to progeria syndrome.
And in the panel C, we evaluated them in an unsupervised clustering,
the general progeria transcriptome pathways that we already know. For example,
cluster 5 and 2 from visual C are much more related to the patient 13-9 and 13-60.
Then you can see clearly cluster 4 and 3, which are much more associated with patients
615 and 800. And then we can see on the heat map, some already known molecules involved in pathways
are partially known from the progeria. And we evaluate, as usually, some kind of genes that
has been described as this kind of markers for specific phenotypes under the UMAP.
And once we evaluate transcriptional profiling, the next step was to perform a single,
so to determine variants, SNP-calling variants within the samples. And for this,
because we are looking at phenotypically differences, we determined the follow conditions.
First of all, because of single-cell RNA has a lot of noise, you have, in order to assess variants,
to use additional data sets, such as bicarbonate sequencing, whole exome sequencing approaches
similar to those, in order to confirm all variants you are getting from the single-cell data.
The second condition was, of course, to evaluate known synonymous mutations,
because this is a very experimental bioinformatic data set.
that most of them were already reported in the database
from a single nucleotide polymorphisms.
And because of phenotype description,
we searched specifically for those variants
that were known uniform distributed.
This mean patient specific.
And we got a list of several hundred of those variants
for each of the samples.
And you can see here a visualization of very few of them.
And we tried, of course, to define some variant
for each of the patients that are labeled in red
in the UMAP.
The next step was based on these variants,
we performed similar to one study from Peethi 2021
published in Nature Communications.
There was a linear regression tool in order to associate,
I have to show you the regular ones in much more detail.
We performed this kind of regular analysis on the left.
You can see all eight samples we analyze
regarding these specific mutation,
in this case for patient 615
and mutation in the gene DAX at this specific position.
And you can see the transcriptional effect
regarding these variants.
And those genes on the upper part of the regular
or heat map are transcriptional markers
suggest to be direct related to this specific mutation.
This is, of course, bioinformatically calculated
and non-functional study has been done till now.
For this reason, we decided to proceed with the next step,
which is in order to confirm the regular results,
we took each of the sample patients,
in this case sample 615 and sample 1360,
we took the mutation we found for the gene DAX,
as well as the mitochondrial SIP,
each of them for each of these specific patients.
And what we found, you can see on the left in red,
I put all genes that has been commonly
detect for this sample
when we are doing differential expression analysis
between mutated cells and non-mutated cells
from these specific patients.
And what was really nice to see is that
when we are doing reactome
and connecting all of these molecules,
we were able to define some pathways
specific for this specific sample based on this mutation,
which was for sample 615,
the transcriptional regulation of TP53,
that's confirmed result from transcriptomic,
I show you from the very beginning.
A part of this, we realized that the gene DAX itself
was differentially expressed, not only mutated,
and is associated, strongly associated
while formative lengthening of telomeres,
which is the main pathway described phenotypically
for these patients.
On the other side, you have the other patient
with the mitochondrial mutation
and the mitochondrial dysfunction in progeria
is the second main pathway associated to progeria.
And we could find a lot of overlap of genes in red,
even again, that were found transcriptionally
as well as in the regular,
as well when we are doing differential expression analysis
between mutated and non-mutated cells.
In this specific case that we found
when you are doing reactome,
that's the restrictional regulation of MSSA is regulated
as well as the MET activation,
and MET activation is something
that has been previously described.
So that we could test by using confirmations
of variants in single cells with other data sets
by using data previously published
that the tools bioinformatically we apply for this
are reliable in this kind of thing.
So, lastly, so I would like to say
that improvement for RNA therapeutic consists
of the choose of downstream application of RNA-Seq
depending of the biological question,
the processing of long non-coding RNAs,
and you sure know that most of biomarkers
currently defined for disease,
especially in oncology are long non-coding RNAs,
to evaluate genetic variants
associated to transcriptional markers
and to evaluate samples phenotype
based on transcriptional and genetic events.
So now I'm finished with this presentation
and of course would like to send my book,
which consists of excellent technical assistance
as well as bioinformaticians working
not only in service staff, much more in research
and students, and especially groups
and institutions in getting has been working
in the development of single cell platform,
especially the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease,
Professor Andrew Fisher, the cardiology,
Professor Hasselbusser, Hubert C. Mehrman,
the oncology and the human genetics
by Professor Dr. Bolognic.
Thank you for your attention.
So I'm happy to hear if you have some questions.
Yeah, thank you very much for this very nice presentation.
Technically very interesting,
also very interesting biology.
If you have questions, please raise your hand
or also type your questions into the chat.
That would be great.
So I can already start with the first question
that has been pasted into the chat.
It comes from Rodrigo Continua de Almeida.
And the question is,
did you look for alternative splicing events
in the ISL8 in combination with the cell in one?
I have to say that the evaluation of splicing variants
by doing full length is of course possible,
especially when you are doing the single total RNA,
because the coverage is much better.
But we never look specifically at this,
much more how would this a coverage
and how deep you need to sequence
in order to perform calling variants with this.
But in theory, the evaluation of this is possible.
Thank you very much.
I personally also have a question until we wait,
maybe there'll be more questions
and I'll ask you in the meantime, what about the costs?
I mean, I think you kind of presented very nice data
on the advantages of combining like the cell in one
and the ISL8 that looks very interesting,
very promising particularly for the kind of large cell types.
Can you say something about costs
in comparison to tele-genomics or other platforms
in terms of per cell costs and overall costs?
Yeah, exactly.
So I already said that the 10 genomic
is evaluating about 7, 800, sorry, 8,000 cells at once.
And if you ask about cost per cell,
sure will be the 10 genomics probably cheaper,
but what I can tell you is the cost
you will need per experiment
and I'm talking about per chip.
So evaluation of three to 4,000 cells,
you have two different steps to consider.
First of all, the dispensing RT chemistry
during libraries for one chip,
which is about 3,900 euros or 4,000 euro around.
And then the sequencing cost and this depend of course,
what you would like to do with the data.
In this particular case, in which we sequence DPIR
in order to determine variants
as well as DPIR transcriptomics,
long non-coding RNAs, whatever,
we sequence 400,000 read per cell.
And these are mostly two lanes
in the high sec 4,000, for example.
And these are costs of about 2,500 only for sequencing.
So then you need to add this
to the 4,000 before 6,500 euro per experiment.
with a very deep sequence.
Yeah, cool.
Good to know.
And if we already get like your direct feedback
from a facility, how many users at the moment
kind of using, for example, this platform
versus others in your lab?
Exactly.
This is a good question because we are working very close
to the human genetics and we are working much more
in clinical trials, in clinical issues.
And for this reason, it will be in the future essential
to evaluate variants beside transcriptomics.
And the most of the researchers work in the cardiology
that would like to assess whole cells and whatever.
So we have 80% of the people using this technology
because it's working fine.
But we still have other people working with 10X,
for example, Andre from the German center for neuro,
he still working with the 10X,
but in case he's looking for low-nobody RNAs,
he knows he has to generate data with the isolate platform
much more than, always depends what you would like to do.
Sorry, I was on mute.
So I ask you once more to paste questions
or raise your hands if you have some.
At the moment, I don't see raised hands.
I have asked one more questions in the meantime.
So I was very intrigued by the long non-coding RNAs
that you can detect now.
I think it's very exciting and indeed, of course,
very difficult with the classical approaches.
So from a more biological term,
I mean, if you basically do these types of analysis
and only subset your data on long non-coding RNAs,
do you also see cell type separation?
So does basically every cell type has really
a unique composition of long non-coding RNAs?
This is an excellent question we have to do.
I have to say that we started with the single cell total RNA
a couple of months ago, mainly working with neurons.
And what we are doing is you map from all of them.
We consider not only long non-coding RNAs,
even the poly-A transcripts,
but sure, with the data we already have,
we can take a look at that,
but we never perform only for this.
Okay, yeah, very exciting.
I'm very much looking forward to see how this looks like.
I think this would be really cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's one more question coming in,
which I think will be our last question
because then we're also kind of at the end of the time.
So Ipek Guneng ask you,
hi, could you maybe explain the difference
in the UMAP between the methods
with ISL8 only versus ISL8 joined with the cell in one?
So to think that by using probably if we did this study
with the genomics, you will get other UMAPs.
So UMAPs are not identical
because you are using different chemistry.
Even in the comparison,
we are not using exactly the same ISL8 chemistry
because of volume differences.
So we are working with 250 nanoliters N volume in the ISL8
and 200 only in the ISL8,
sorry, in the combination with 250
and in ISL8 only with 200.
So there is a lot of differences in volume
and performances.
Still the same chemistry,
but you are not able to generate
working with different platforms,
same visualization of clusters.
And this can vary.
And this is an important thing
because I would like to sensibilize people
to go out from clusters and to shower,
take a look at the data in much more detail.
Many people need to understand what's mean a cluster.
Our cells like are probably much more apoptotic
than what's because markers even are difficult
to define cell types mostly.
In the single cell atlas,
the information coming from different cell types
and tissues is even very heterogeneous.
And for this reason,
I think that to shower UMAPs
and to over-interpretate this basal cluster
is always a mistake researchers are doing.
Thank you very much for this explanation.
Very interesting with this,
and we are slightly over time.
And I would like to thank you again, Gabriella,
for giving this really nice overview,
both on the technical aspect
and particularly I think important for fragile cells
and for large cells.
I think it's a really, really important contribution here
and really important insights,
but also in all the other aspects that you mentioned,
really interesting presentation.
I would like to remind you that in case you missed something
and this session is recorded,
so you can basically rewatch it
if you're interested in specific details
that you may have missed.
I would also like to remind you that in two weeks,
we have another SCOP meeting or SCOP presentation
by Dr. Tashibana from Munich,
the 1st of July, same time as today, 9.30.
And with this, yeah, thanks again, Gabriella,
for this nice presentation.
And I wish you all a great Friday
and a nice weekend ahead of you.
