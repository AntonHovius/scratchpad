The study of genes is a perennial topic in biology. Our
understanding of genes—the nucleotide sequence, the
gene structure, the gene function and expression—has
reached an unprecedented level [1]. In eukaryotes, the
genetic material DNA binds to histones to form nucleosomes, which fold and condense to form chromatin
[2, 3]. In the processes of DNA replication and transcription, some regions of chromatin are opened [4], i.e.
depleted of nucleosomes. Regulatory elements [such as
transcription factors (TFs)] can bind to the exposed DNA
sites in open regions and regulate DNA replication or
transcription [5]. In addition, the chromatin structure can
undergo dynamic epigenetic modifications, such as DNA
methylation [6], histone modification [7] and chromatin
remodelling [8], which are difficult to fully detect by
traditional molecular techniques.
Because the interaction between protein and DNA
inf luences gene expression, it has been the focus of
intense interest. Immunoprecipitation is a technique for
protein enrichment using the principle of antibody binding, which is the foundation of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) [9].
The DNA bound to the target is then sequenced to reveal
its binding sites in the genome [10, 11]. More recently,
ATAC-seq, which uses Tn5 transposase to cleave only
those regions of DNA that are not protected by bound
proteins [12, 13], has been used to assay dynamic changes
of chromatin structure. ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq are
therefore highly consistent and complementary. ATACseq and ChIP-seq can be integrated to explore the mechanism of protein regulation of gene expression, making
it possible to identify transcriptional differences caused
by transcription initiation regulatory factors. Together
with RNA-seq, which determines the expression level of
specific RNA, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq can be integrated
to provide a unified picture of gene expression regulation
[14]. Integrated analysis of multiple sequencing methods
provides a powerful means for annotating the functional
features of the genome, revealing the mechanisms of
gene regulation at the frontiers of biology [15].
