Introduction

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited disorder caused by muta- tions in the FBN1 gene encoding the fibrillin-1 protein.1,2 Abnormal fibrillin results in higher signalling through the TGF-b pathway3 with increased phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which may contribute to aortic medial degeneration. Aortic complications, such as dilation, dissection, and rupture are the leading causes of MFS-related mor- tality. Advances in diagnosis and surgical prophylactic ascending aor- ta replacement have improved the prognosis and life expectancy of patients.4,5 Therapy with b-adrenergic blockers has shown a bene- ficial effect in reducing aortic dilation progression,6 – 8 and has been proposed as the standard treatment for MFS.9 However, angioten- sin II-receptor blockers are emerging as potential alternatives to b-blockers. Losartan is an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor an- tagonist which attenuates canonical and non-canonical transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) signalling in the aorta and inhibits TGF-b-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated ki- nase.10 This drug significantly reduced the aortic dilation rate, first in a Marfan mouse model and later in a small observational study in children with MFS.11 The COMPARE study revealed a significantly lower aortic dilation rate in patients treated with losartan-b-blocker therapy compared with b-blockers alone. However, these results were not confirmed in the recent Marfan Sartan trial in which 86% of patients received b-blocker therapy.13 Furthermore, a large clin- ical trial including children and young adults showed no benefit in aortic root dilation assessed by echocardiography when losartan was compared with atenolol over a 3-year period.14 Discrepancies in the results of these trials may be due to treatment study designs (additional beneficial effect of losartan superiority over b-blockers), differences in drug doses, study population, or imaging modality used to measure aorta dilation. To date, no prospective randomized clinical trial has compared the benefits of losartan vs. atenolol as a monotherapy in the treatment of MFS assessed by magnetic reson- ance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging permits accurate and tridimensional measurement of aortic dimensions and is of cru- cial importance in MFS patients in whom aortic root asymmetry is not uncommon15 (Figure 1). The primary aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of lo- sartan and atenolol in the prevention of progressive aortic dilation in MFS patients. A secondary aim of the study was to compare the in- cidence of clinical end-points (aortic dissection or rupture, need for cardiac surgery and death) during follow-up between the losartan and atenolol groups.

Methods

Trial design

A phase IIIb, randomized, parallel, double-blind study of 140 MFS patients was conducted at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) and Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain) between 2008 and 2013. Losartan and atenolol were purchased and the manufacturers had no role in the study. The trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committees of the hospitals. The trial is registered in the EU Clinical Trial Registry. 2007-001125-97 and in ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01145612. All patients (or their guardians) provided written informed consent.

Participants

Inclusion criteria for participation in the study were: MFS diagnosis (based on original Ghent criteria),16 age between 5 and 60 years and maximum aortic root diameter ,45 mm. Exclusion criteria were: his- tory of aortic dissection or cardiac/aortic surgery, grade III/IV aortic regurgitation, history of angioedema or any other intolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers or b-blockers, treatment with other cardiovascular drugs, pregnancy or planned pregnancy in the next 3 years, history of asthma, respiratory fail- ure, kidney, or neurological disease. Patients previously receiving b-blockers went through a 4-week ‘wash-out’ period.

Interventions

In both treatments, the starting dose was 25 mg/day for the first 15 days, rising to 100 mg depending on clinical tolerance and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. In patients with body weight ,50 kg, the dose was individually adjusted according to body weight, starting at 12.5 mg/day for the first 15 days and rising to 1.4 mg/kg/day depending on clinical tolerance.

Outcomes
Primary end-point: changes in aortic root and ascending aorta diameter indexed by body surface area (BSA) on MRI after 36 months of treat- ment with losartan vs. atenolol.
Secondary end-point: events during follow-up including aortic dissec- tion or rupture, need for aortic intervention or heart surgery and death. Participant monitoring Patients were closely followed by clinical and transthoracic echocardi- ography (TTE) controls every 6 months by the same investigators at each hospital. Clinical follow-up included specific inquiry into the pres- ence of symptoms and treatment compliance. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring (SpaceLabs 90217 monitor, SpaceLabs Medical, Redmond, WA, USA) was carried out at baseline and at the end of the study, or when the patient presented symptoms of hypotension. Blood pressure was taken every 20 min dur- ing the daytime and every hour during the night. Measured values of sys- tolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate were stored and evaluated according to the established recommendations.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the entire aorta was performed at baseline before the start of the study medication and at the end of the 3-year treatment. All MRI studies were performed at the two cen- tres using a 1.5-T system (Signa Excite GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Steady-state free precession cine acquisitions were obtained in held expiration and ECG synchronization using the following para- meters: field of view 350 × 297 mm, matrix size 256 × 192, repeti-tion time, 50 ms, and slice thickness 6 mm. Perpendicular cineimages were obtained at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva, and as- cending aorta (at the level of the pulmonary bifurcation) using the double-oblique technique. The three cusp-to-commissure diameters were measured at the level of the aortic root at the end-diastolic frame; the maximum of the three diameters at baseline and at follow- up were considered for analysis (Figure 1). Maximum ascending aortic diameter was also measured. All measurements were indexed by BSA. Measurements were taken by a blinded observer (G.T.) using the QFlow software package, version 5.5 (Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands).

Intra- and inter-observer variability of aortic diameter at the sinus of Valsalva by MRI showed excellent reproducibility (intra-and inter- observer mean difference of 0.2 + 1.5 and 0.3 + 1.6 mm, respectively; intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.94, P , 0.001 and 0.93, P , 0.001, respectively). Randomization and masking
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive losartan or atenolol. The trial followed a double-blinded design. A computer-generated scheme using randomly permuted blocks of 10 was used. A sealed opa- que envelope containing information on the type of study medication assigned and random allocation number was provided for each patient by the Pharmacy Department. Containers and both study medications were identical in colour and shape. The randomization code was not available to the investigators, thereby ensuring masking assignment.

Statistical analysis

Sample size calculation was based on the primary end-point. An annual aortic root dilation rate of 1 mm17 with an approximate SD of 2 mm would be expected. Considering a two-sided hypothesis testing, patients per group was estimated to detect a difference between treat- ments, in the total dilation rate, of 1 mm after 3 years (a ¼ 0.05; b ¼ 0.2). The final sample size was set at 140 patients (70 per group) to allow for drop-outs and patient loss during follow-up.
Analysis of covariance with the baseline aortic dimension as covariate was employed to evaluate the effect of losartan and atenolol on the aor- tic dilation change. Multiple testing correction was performed using a permutation approach of 1000 permutations.12 Covariance was em- ployed for subgroup analyses according to age, sex, baseline mean arter- ial pressure, and baseline aortic dimensions. Finally, multiple linear regression analysis was used to adjust for some differences between groups in baseline covariates of sex, age, and BSA. Analyses were made following the modified intention-to-treat principle. Therefore, all patients in each group who had received at least one dose of the study treatment assigned were considered for analysis. Outcomes in all patients with MRI were analysed and missing data in the primary out- come variable were excluded from the analysis. Qualitative variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies, and quantitative variables as the mean and SD. Statistical significance was considered
when P ≤ 0.05 (two sided). The comparison of continuous variables
was made by Student’s t-test or the repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA). When normality was not assumed, non-parametric analyses were made instead.
Statistical procedures were performed using SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and R statistical package (Rstudio, 0.98 953; R base, 3.2.1).

Role of the funding source

The trial was funded and sponsored entirely by the Spanish Ministry of Science, which had no participation in the study design, data collection, analysis, or manuscript writing.

Results

One hundred and forty patients (25.2 + 13.7 years, 60% females) were enrolled: 70 randomly assigned to receive losartan and 70 to atenolol (Figure 2). At baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed in patient characteristics and aorta size measure- ments between groups (Table 1). Although genetic analysis was not an inclusion criterion, 119 patients underwent genetic analysis, of whom 97 (82%) were FBN1 positive. A losartan dosage of 100 mg or 1.4 mg/kg daily was achieved in 66 patients (94.3%). In four pa- tients, losartan was reduced to 50 mg/daily owing to dizziness caused by low BP. An atenolol dosage of 100 mg or 1.4 mg/kg daily was achieved in 64 patients (91.4%). In six patients, atenolol was re- duced to 50 mg/daily owing to extreme fatigue in two, dyspnoea in one, and dizziness in three. Maximum doses in patients ,50 kg was 1.29 + 0.12 mg/kg/day in the losartan group and 1.33 + 0.15 mg/kg/ day in the atenolol group. Four patients prematurely stopped losar- tan and six atenolol.

During follow-up, five patients suffered aortic events: two re- quired prophylactic aortic root surgery, one a type A dissection treated surgically, and two type B dissections, one of whom died in the acute phase. Although four of the five patients with aortic complications were from the atenolol group, no statistically signifi- cant difference was observed between treatment groups (P ¼ 0.366). Fifty-one and 48 patients in the losartan and atenolol groups, re- spectively, underwent 24-h BP monitoring at baseline and after 3 of losartan was observed on aortic root diameter regardless of sex, age group, and baseline mean BP (Figure 5).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind trial using MRI to compare the efficacy of losartan and atenolol, given as monotherapy, to prevent aortic dilation in MFS patients. The changes in aortic root and ascending aorta indexed maximum dia- meters over 3 years of treatment did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The results of the present study did not demon- strate differences between treatments in their efficacy to prevent aortic dilation in MFS.

Several studies reported that b-blocker therapy delays the pro- gression of aortic root dilation6 – 8 and is the standard treatment for the prevention of aortic complications in MFS patients. How- ever, other trials identified a subset of MFS patients not responding to b-blocker treatment.18 – 20 It is generally admitted that the effi- cacy of b-blockers depends on their ability to reduce the mechanical impact on the aortic wall by limiting the force of left ventricular ejec- tion (i.e. dp/dt) and heart rate. In a mouse model of MFS, losartan induced a decrease in TGF-b signalling and was superior to atenolol in preventing aortic root dilation and elastic fibre degeneration.10 However, a recent publication suggested that TGF-b hyperactiv- ity represents a marker of impaired tissue repair rather than the initial trigger of arterial disease and argued for a treatment strategy that would target both promiscuous AT1 receptors and TGF-b sig- nalling without interfering with the early protective role of TGF-b activity.21
Later, several small observational studies in children showed a sig- nificant reduction in aortic root enlargement in patients receiving lo- sartan in addition to b-blockers.11,22,23 However, a recently published trial including a large cohort of children and young adults found no significant differences in the rate of aortic root dilation by TTE between the losartan and atenolol groups.14 In that study, aten- olol dose was markedly higher than in ours (2.7 + 1.1 mg/kg/day) and losartan similar, leading to a slight but significant decrease in mean DBP in the atenolol group. This higher dose of the b-blocker and its effect on blood pressure could have favoured a b-blocker re- duction in the aortic growth rate. Moreover, aortic dilation in our cohort (mean aortic root Z-score 3.2 + 2.2) was smaller than in the Lacro study (median Z-score 4.0). Therefore, our results are in line with those results of the Pediatric Heart Network trial but extend the information on the effect of losartan vs. atenolol treat- ment as a monotherapy in an older MFS population (with .50% of patients over 25 years of age) and with less dilated aortic root
(Z-score ≤3 in 40% of patients).
Two recent European trials reported discrepancies in the bene- ficial effect of losartan added to previous medical b-blocker treat- ment.12,13 The COMPARE trial,12 a randomized, open-label, controlled trial in 145 adult MFS patients, found a significantly lower aortic dilation rate in those treated with the losartan-b-blocker combination compared with b-blocker therapy alone. However, in the Marfan Sartan trial,13 a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial in 303 adult patients, the aortic root diameter was not modified by the adjunction of losartan to baseline therapy over the 3-year treatment. Although both trials included a similar profile of MFS patients, and b-blockers were continued in .75% of patients, doses of this drug were not pre-established. Maximum losartan doses and their effects may be influenced by this combin- ation. In fact, during the course of the study, losartan treatment was prematurely stopped in 15% of patients in the COMPARE trial and 28% of patients in the Marfan Sartan trial. Since both b-blockers and losartan might be effective in MFS, a synergistic but different ef- fect of the combination of both treatments cannot be ruled out. As in other trials, no significant relationship was found between the re- duction in BP and changes in aortic size. However, comparison of two ambulatory BP determinations or in the scheduled visits may not be sufficiently robust to rule out an interaction between aortic size changes and the decrease in BP. As in the COMPARE study, we used MRI as one of the most accurate techniques for evaluating aor- tic size enlargement. In MFS, the frequent aortic root asymmetry may be a limitation when measuring maximum aortic root diameter by TTE15 (Figure 1). In addition, inter-observer variability, particular- ly in patients with a chest deformation, is better by MRI than TTE. Since the maximum diameter indicates the management and risk of aortic complications in MFS, we considered the change in max- imum diameter to be the primary end-point. In our series, we found that maximum growth was observed at the maximum basal diam- eter. As in other studies, a reduction in indexed aortic root diameter was observed in treated MFS patients, particularly in the younger population.11,14,22 – 24 A possible explanation for the decrease in indexed aortic root could be that body size increases more rapidly than aorta size in most children.
Despite the promising findings of losartan treatment of Marfan in mouse models, these results were not confirmed in our study. Al- though we have no clear explanation for these discrepancies, one possibility could be the wide genetic heterogeneity of MFS pa- tients25 compared with the homogeneous genetic background of the mouse model. Recently, the type of FBN-1 mutation—based on biochemical effects on the fibrillin-1 protein—was related to the losartan effect, which was more beneficial in patients with hap- loinsufficiency compared with dominant negative mutations.26
Our study has significant differences with previously published trials since the effects of losartan and atenolol, as monotherapy, in maximum indexed aortic root diameter changes was determined by MRI. Most studied patients were adults with mild– moderate aorta dilation, and target treatment doses were reached in the majority of cases. The results of our study did not show significant differences in aortic dilation progression between losartan and atenolol over the 3-year treatment, and in fact there was a trend towards a greater re- duction in the indexed diameter in the losartan group. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider losartan as an alternative to atenolol, especially in patients with intolerance or side effects to this drug. Other trials are currently underway, and a planned meta-analysis may permit a more precise definition of the role of losartan in the management of MFS patients.27

Limitations

Age heterogeneity could have been a limitation of the present study. Nevertheless, we normalized aorta size by BSA, as did most studies, to reduce variability. Although the final sample size in our study was not large, it sufficed to detect clinically relevant differences of 1 mm/ 3 years in the aortic root dilation rate between treatment groups.

Conclusions

The results of our study showed no differences in the effects of lo- sartan and atenolol on changes in aortic root and ascending aorta diameters in MFS patients. Although the study was neutral for the primary end-point, further studies are required to ascertain the ef- fect of losartan therapy in certain subgroups of patients regarding aortic root diameter, age, or type of gene mutation.
