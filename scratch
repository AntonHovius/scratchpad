I would like to talk today
about technical improvements in single-cell RNA sequencing, delivering the promise of
RNA therapeutics. And for this, I would like to start today with current integrated systems
for single-cell sequencing, which includes systems that are able to dispense cells with
the quality control of collected cells, as well as the downstream applications you can
perform in the same instruments. And we are talking in general about RNA single-cell sequencing.
But even I would like to present to you today other approaches that can be performed, such
as single-cell genomic DNA or some other applications regarding epigenetics, such as ATECH single-cell.
Afterwards, I would like to talk or to give you some improvement of a single-cell collection,
presentation, and especially chemistry, then to talk about the way you can perform transcriptomics
within a cell in terms of evaluating messenger RNAs or poly-A transcript, but also, at the
same time, to evaluate a large number of long-gnogolin RNAs. And finally, to talk about multi-omics
data analysis, in this specific case, collecting genotype to phenotype within the same cell.
So I think that screen is light. As you can see, in the panel, you can see a microfluidic
droplet system from the 10 Genomics. And as you sure know, most of the people who work
in single-cell sequencing is using this platform. And more than 95% of the data reported in
the Cell Atlas is coming from this platform. And it's, of course, the best platform in
terms of high throughput, because you are able to evaluate several thousand of cells
at once, especially helpfully when you are starting with very heterogeneous tissues.
But we in our core unit realize that for many, many, and not only clinical projects,
this platform has limitations, because most of the people need, if you are interested
or interested in specific cells or sub-population cells starting with heterogeneous tissues,
mostly you need to select cells based on different methods. But working with the 10
genomics, one of the methods is the fact sorting prior to sequencing or to preparation of libraries.
Apart of this, most of the people are working with single nuclei because of cell sizing
limitations, and all cells over 35 microns are mostly not assessed during the procedure
of cell capturing in the 10 genomics. Especially the chemistry the system is using the 10 genomics,
they are using oligo-dt for cDNA synthesis, and the cDNA synthesis is like partially,
so you are able to sequence only short pieces nearly to the three-end or five-end of the
transcript, but the full length approach is still missing. For this reason, we introduce
an additional platform, which is well established as well as the 10 genomics. This is the isolate.
The isolate platform is working basically using a nanowell plate. In this specific case,
we are using a plate with 5,184 nanowells, and the instruments offer an integrated imaging
system. Mostly you can work with a maximal of two fluorescence types. We are mostly using
DAPI in order to distinguish living cells, and Texas Red to discard dead cells from the
single cell suspension. Apart of this, the imaging system allows you to distinguish or
to eliminate from the further processes cell debris or clustering or cell doublets and
so on. The most beautiful thing for the isolate, and I'm sure you all know this, is the flexibility
in chemistry for RNA sequencing, because you can access a transcript very similar to the 10x
sequencing with three-end fragments, but even you have the choice to go for full length approaches,
and the instruments allow you even to develop some self-made protocols or custom solutions
that are not part of the, let's say, portfolio from Takara chemistry. What we are currently doing
are only full length approaches because of clinical questions, and we aim to evaluate
a part of the transcriptomics. We would like to see how worse the variant calling there
and possibly to associate this with transcriptomic evidence. The disadvantage of the Cell N1
is that the system, you started with 5,000 cells, but once we proceed with the quality control,
only between 1,000 and 1,600 cells will be selected for further processing,
and this is, of course, especially in comparison with the 10 genomics to less.
For this reason, in panel C, you can see an additional instrument, this is the seven one instrument is basically a dispenser, and that have the best and really beautiful quality imaging system, because the system, allow you to send it sales.
Based on morphology, independent of cell sizing, because you can access cells, common cells that vary in a range of sizing from two to over 500 micrometers.
A part of this, we are using this to in order to improve the capturing rate from thousand cells to three or four thousands, nearly 4000 cells during one run.
And for this, the first things we did in panel D is to combine the isolate with the seven one using the seven one for cell dispensing and quality controls, using the Kakara 5184 chip.
This is the first things we implemented in our laboratory, and we are performing a quality control there, and once we dispense cells, we can use exactly the same chip and put this in the isolate for for more or for specific downstream applications and today I would like to
focus on RNA sequencing. For people that probably doesn't know how it works, the isolate is selecting by using a software from the company, is selecting a living cells, and by staining and imaging, you can discard for example in panel B, you can see
multiple cells, or in the middle the dead cells because the stain even in Texas parade is visible, or cell debris, or cell debris, so that you can select the only good cells prior sequencing.
And here, I would like to present you.
This is a show by the first time in our group, because we currently are cooperating with people from the anatomy from the group from slavery.
They are working with one says, and in this case you can see peripheral nervous systems says that has a sizing.
First of all, a very unusual morphology.
And second, you will find cells between 200 and 500 micrometers in size, and by using three different fluorophores we could visualize this in the isolate, and currently we are able to assess these difficult cells and sequence these in a whole cell manner,
without a nuclei isolation.
The next.
So for this reason we decide to, to combine the seven one system for cell dispensing based on cell morphology, based on cell sizing, or the instrument allow you to work from one to four different floor force in order to sell it real says from a
tissues.
And once we proceed with the quality control. We are working on the isolated then by using exactly the same chip. So, the whole procedure from cell dispensing to library preparation occurs, using one chip step.
So in the isolate the first things we are doing then after collection is proceed with the RT pre amplification incorporation of indexing mostly this is the protocol for full length approaches because we are performing only those.
And then we proceed after indexing with the pigmentation reaction and the library. And this process from the cell dispensing till the library generation takes two days fully automated.
And most important thing is when we started with this with this novel system. We, we started this because people working, for example in the cardiology, asked for the sequencing for in in whole cells mode for says, such as a cardio myocytes and
actually sure no cardio myocytes are very unstable cells and very unusual in morphology because the, the, the living cells, and what says are those with this cylindrical morphology you can see in the middle.
And for this reason we check how the instrument access says over, let's say, hundred microns and you can see in the, in the first panel on the left.
And we started with a normal nuclei isolation after tissue dissociation, and the dispensing of cells is going very straightforward, as well as the, as the library preparation.
This is no problem, and you can call it says within 30 minutes in the middle one, you have the an example of tissue dissociation and reach cardio myocytes and you can see different morphologies they are all of them are cardio myocyte but you can see
that the other cells that are not seeing rate is like apoptotic is not cell dead but nearly to. And we could assess based on this morphology in the UMAP, you can see two different clusters that are coming from these different morphologies.
And this kind of things you can also evaluate assessing quality control, and in order to perform a qualities in morphology and evaluate the state of the cell.
And in the, in the last picture. This is an example from IPSS differentiated to cardio myocytes.
These are cells with normal sizing from 24 to 50 micrometers, and the system is working really fine with this.
And
in the next picture, we tested the, the, the performances of the single cell RNA sequencing, working with nuclei, and we have several oncological approaches in this specific case, we started or tested the system with a frozen biopsies in this specific case what
you can see is the evaluation of three different patients with pancreatic cancer. And what you can see are three different phenotypes of pancreatic cancer.
And this study has been done by using nuclei because once you have frozen tissues, you are not able to work with cold cells because they are not living cells and for this reason we decided to match or to, or to make a match study, starting with the original
tumors, or from the patients, then the researchers working in this, in this project, and they develop a PDX mice using the original tumor patient, as well as organoids.
And we perform with these different three patients, a study demonstrating that nuclei is working really, really fine with the system. And if you take a look on the other part of the slide, the frozen tissues exhibit always less amount of exonic reads, which is normal
but what we see from the data analysis is that is still good for for aging expression analysis.
So to put this in summary, the use of the single one and isolating combination, allow you to perform from the dispensing to the library preparation.
All in by using one step, only one chip, allow you the analysis of all cells independent of sizing and cell morphology from two to 500 micrometers.
And allow the analysis of living cell, as well as fixed cells, which has been already tested by us in our laboratory. Analysis of nuclei, starting with frozen tissues.
And the most interesting thing is the flexibility in chemistry for different approaches of single cell RNA sequencing. The three end approach, the full length approach, improving the data analysis for detection variants,
and the three end approach, the full length approach, improving the data analysis for detection variants, and the three end approach, improving the data analysis for detection variants.
And the last developed method by us was the single cell total RNA-Seq, which allow you
a beautiful identification of long non-coding RNAs beside the messenger RNAs.
Now we are coming to the second part of the presentation, because the first things we
did in cooperation with the group from Andrew Fisher from the German Center for Neurodegenerative
Disease was to evaluate the performances of the total single cell RNA-Seq on the isolate
fully automated, and Andrew is working on the identification of several long intergenic
non-coding RNAs in human brain, a part of this astrocyte might probably have neuron-specific
studies, and even to find some long-coding RNAs in heart, heart-specific long non-coding
RNAs.
For this reason, we started with him, and Andrew is working since two or three years
deep here with the 10 genomics and generates a lot of data, and the first things we did
is to compare the performances of full-length approaches independent of single cell total
or the normal full-length approach.
I have to say that all approaches are not done by using Oligo-DTP, always we are talking
about random hexamers in order for full coverage of transcriptomics, and what you can see is
this is a pilot data, specifically for neuron-specific long non-coding RNAs data, so first of all,
a global U-map from the different kind of neuron-specific, and you can see that by evaluating
isolate in full-length mode, the sensitivity of the assays in terms of detection of messenger
RNAs or coding RNAs are higher than in the PENIX, and especially if you are specifically
looking at long non-coding RNAs, you can see that the isolate is the platform of choice.
Now we are coming specifically because we are proposing a combination of instruments,
cell and one isolate, and for this, of course, we need to evaluate methodologically how good
is the performances of the combination when we are comparing this with the isolate, which
is, besides the PENIX, a well-established single cell system, and the goal was first
to evaluate technical improvements by using this combination, and the second goal was
to bioinformatically demonstrate how good you can access coding variants that could
probably be associated to transcriptomic markers in order to define phenotypically differences
between samples. For this reason, we choose a special cohort of samples. In this case,
we took progeria samples. These are dermal fibroblasts from patients, and we chose six
different progeria samples that have been previously described as phenotypically different,
and we include, of course, two controls, and started with the wet lab performances in which we
dispense exactly the same samples on one Takara isolate chip, 5184 nanowells, and on the other
hand, three different chips that should work only in the isolate as usual or as standard, let's say.
Why this? Because in order to compare the methods, we need to generate after-quality
contracts about the same amount of cells, and you can see that in both submerging data from
three chips in the isolate, we got something like 3,100 cells, very comparable to the performance
of the combination by using only one chip. In the table, you can see how many cells we
dispense from the very beginning and how much cells, per sample, we got after-quality controls.
I have to say that this quality control is not regarding the instrument itself. It's after
bioinformatic analysis evaluating housekeeping genes, performances, number of genes detected per
cell, in media, and whatever. So after the first bioinformatic data-quality control.
The first results we get technically, again, we started with exactly the same amount of cells for
the isolate alone, as well as for the combination, which were about 3,000 cells. Then we sequenced
exactly in the same way to get about 400,000 reads in media per cell for both approaches.
And the first thing we observed is that by using the isolate alone, you will be able to
assess much more exonic reads. But if you take a look on the feature A, the amount of intronic
as well as intergenic reads from the combination is much higher. In the feature B, you can see that
all transcript we found in the isolate, in the well-established isolate, were found even in the
combination. And much more, especially long-known coding RNAs, were found in the combination. And
in feature C, you can see an RNA biotyping from both technologies. And even you, I showed you
in the slide before that the performances of isolate in terms of coding RNAs in comparison
with the techniques is excellent. But you can see here that when you compare the combination,
we are able to assess much more long-known coding RNAs that are working with the isolate alone.
Okay. Technically, we can say that the combination is working really fine and that the
overlap between well-established technologies, such as the isolate, is the performances of the
combination is working really fine. Now, we are coming much more in terms of biological evaluation.
And the first thing we did is, of course, this is a very common data analysis, nothing special,
because we proceed with data visualization, how we would classroom the patients in the UMAP from
the combination and the isolate alone. In panel B, you can see a top-handed markers or genes found
through the whole progeria samples, because in this disease, you will find many, many genes
that are differentially expressed that are common or associated directly to progeria syndrome.
And in the panel C, we evaluated them in an unsupervised clustering,
the general progeria transcriptome pathways that we already know. For example,
cluster 5 and 2 from visual C are much more related to the patient 13-9 and 13-60.
Then you can see clearly cluster 4 and 3, which are much more associated with patients
615 and 800. And then we can see on the heat map, some already known molecules involved in pathways
are partially known from the progeria. And we evaluate, as usually, some kind of genes that
has been described as this kind of markers for specific phenotypes under the UMAP.
And once we evaluate transcriptional profiling, the next step was to perform a single,
so to determine variants, SNP-calling variants within the samples. And for this,
because we are looking at phenotypically differences, we determined the follow conditions.
First of all, because of single-cell RNA has a lot of noise, you have, in order to assess variants,
to use additional data sets, such as bicarbonate sequencing, whole exome sequencing approaches
similar to those, in order to confirm all variants you are getting from the single-cell data.
The second condition was, of course, to evaluate known synonymous mutations,
because this is a very experimental bioinformatic data set.
that most of them were already reported in the database
from a single nucleotide polymorphisms.
And because of phenotype description,
we searched specifically for those variants
that were known uniform distributed.
This mean patient specific.
And we got a list of several hundred of those variants
for each of the samples.
And you can see here a visualization of very few of them.
And we tried, of course, to define some variant
for each of the patients that are labeled in red
in the UMAP.
The next step was based on these variants,
we performed similar to one study from Peethi 2021
published in Nature Communications.
There was a linear regression tool in order to associate,
I have to show you the regular ones in much more detail.
We performed this kind of regular analysis on the left.
You can see all eight samples we analyze
regarding these specific mutation,
in this case for patient 615
and mutation in the gene DAX at this specific position.
And you can see the transcriptional effect
regarding these variants.
And those genes on the upper part of the regular
or heat map are transcriptional markers
suggest to be direct related to this specific mutation.
This is, of course, bioinformatically calculated
and non-functional study has been done till now.
For this reason, we decided to proceed with the next step,
which is in order to confirm the regular results,
we took each of the sample patients,
in this case sample 615 and sample 1360,
we took the mutation we found for the gene DAX,
as well as the mitochondrial SIP,
each of them for each of these specific patients.
And what we found, you can see on the left in red,
I put all genes that has been commonly
detect for this sample
when we are doing differential expression analysis
between mutated cells and non-mutated cells
from these specific patients.
And what was really nice to see is that
when we are doing reactome
and connecting all of these molecules,
we were able to define some pathways
specific for this specific sample based on this mutation,
which was for sample 615,
the transcriptional regulation of TP53,
that's confirmed result from transcriptomic,
I show you from the very beginning.
A part of this, we realized that the gene DAX itself
was differentially expressed, not only mutated,
and is associated, strongly associated
while formative lengthening of telomeres,
which is the main pathway described phenotypically
for these patients.
On the other side, you have the other patient
with the mitochondrial mutation
and the mitochondrial dysfunction in progeria
is the second main pathway associated to progeria.
And we could find a lot of overlap of genes in red,
even again, that were found transcriptionally
as well as in the regular,
as well when we are doing differential expression analysis
between mutated and non-mutated cells.
In this specific case that we found
when you are doing reactome,
that's the restrictional regulation of MSSA is regulated
as well as the MET activation,
and MET activation is something
that has been previously described.
So that we could test by using confirmations
of variants in single cells with other data sets
by using data previously published
that the tools bioinformatically we apply for this
are reliable in this kind of thing.
So, lastly, so I would like to say
that improvement for RNA therapeutic consists
of the choose of downstream application of RNA-Seq
depending of the biological question,
the processing of long non-coding RNAs,
and you sure know that most of biomarkers
currently defined for disease,
especially in oncology are long non-coding RNAs,
to evaluate genetic variants
associated to transcriptional markers
and to evaluate samples phenotype
based on transcriptional and genetic events.
So now I'm finished with this presentation
and of course would like to send my book,
which consists of excellent technical assistance
as well as bioinformaticians working
not only in service staff, much more in research
and students, and especially groups
and institutions in getting has been working
in the development of single cell platform,
especially the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease,
Professor Andrew Fisher, the cardiology,
Professor Hasselbusser, Hubert C. Mehrman,
the oncology and the human genetics
by Professor Dr. Bolognic.
Thank you for your attention.
So I'm happy to hear if you have some questions.
Yeah, thank you very much for this very nice presentation.
Technically very interesting,
also very interesting biology.
If you have questions, please raise your hand
or also type your questions into the chat.
That would be great.
So I can already start with the first question
that has been pasted into the chat.
It comes from Rodrigo Continua de Almeida.
And the question is,
did you look for alternative splicing events
in the ISL8 in combination with the cell in one?
I have to say that the evaluation of splicing variants
by doing full length is of course possible,
especially when you are doing the single total RNA,
because the coverage is much better.
But we never look specifically at this,
much more how would this a coverage
and how deep you need to sequence
in order to perform calling variants with this.
But in theory, the evaluation of this is possible.
Thank you very much.
I personally also have a question until we wait,
maybe there'll be more questions
and I'll ask you in the meantime, what about the costs?
I mean, I think you kind of presented very nice data
on the advantages of combining like the cell in one
and the ISL8 that looks very interesting,
very promising particularly for the kind of large cell types.
Can you say something about costs
in comparison to tele-genomics or other platforms
in terms of per cell costs and overall costs?
Yeah, exactly.
So I already said that the 10 genomic
is evaluating about 7, 800, sorry, 8,000 cells at once.
And if you ask about cost per cell,
sure will be the 10 genomics probably cheaper,
but what I can tell you is the cost
you will need per experiment
and I'm talking about per chip.
So evaluation of three to 4,000 cells,
you have two different steps to consider.
First of all, the dispensing RT chemistry
during libraries for one chip,
which is about 3,900 euros or 4,000 euro around.
And then the sequencing cost and this depend of course,
what you would like to do with the data.
In this particular case, in which we sequence DPIR
in order to determine variants
as well as DPIR transcriptomics,
long non-coding RNAs, whatever,
we sequence 400,000 read per cell.
And these are mostly two lanes
in the high sec 4,000, for example.
And these are costs of about 2,500 only for sequencing.
So then you need to add this
to the 4,000 before 6,500 euro per experiment.
with a very deep sequence.
Yeah, cool.
Good to know.
And if we already get like your direct feedback
from a facility, how many users at the moment
kind of using, for example, this platform
versus others in your lab?
Exactly.
This is a good question because we are working very close
to the human genetics and we are working much more
in clinical trials, in clinical issues.
And for this reason, it will be in the future essential
to evaluate variants beside transcriptomics.
And the most of the researchers work in the cardiology
that would like to assess whole cells and whatever.
So we have 80% of the people using this technology
because it's working fine.
But we still have other people working with 10X,
for example, Andre from the German center for neuro,
he still working with the 10X,
but in case he's looking for low-nobody RNAs,
he knows he has to generate data with the isolate platform
much more than, always depends what you would like to do.
Sorry, I was on mute.
So I ask you once more to paste questions
or raise your hands if you have some.
At the moment, I don't see raised hands.
I have asked one more questions in the meantime.
So I was very intrigued by the long non-coding RNAs
that you can detect now.
I think it's very exciting and indeed, of course,
very difficult with the classical approaches.
So from a more biological term,
I mean, if you basically do these types of analysis
and only subset your data on long non-coding RNAs,
do you also see cell type separation?
So does basically every cell type has really
a unique composition of long non-coding RNAs?
This is an excellent question we have to do.
I have to say that we started with the single cell total RNA
a couple of months ago, mainly working with neurons.
And what we are doing is you map from all of them.
We consider not only long non-coding RNAs,
even the poly-A transcripts,
but sure, with the data we already have,
we can take a look at that,
but we never perform only for this.
Okay, yeah, very exciting.
I'm very much looking forward to see how this looks like.
I think this would be really cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's one more question coming in,
which I think will be our last question
because then we're also kind of at the end of the time.
So Ipek Guneng ask you,
hi, could you maybe explain the difference
in the UMAP between the methods
with ISL8 only versus ISL8 joined with the cell in one?
So to think that by using probably if we did this study
with the genomics, you will get other UMAPs.
So UMAPs are not identical
because you are using different chemistry.
Even in the comparison,
we are not using exactly the same ISL8 chemistry
because of volume differences.
So we are working with 250 nanoliters N volume in the ISL8
and 200 only in the ISL8,
sorry, in the combination with 250
and in ISL8 only with 200.
So there is a lot of differences in volume
and performances.
Still the same chemistry,
but you are not able to generate
working with different platforms,
same visualization of clusters.
And this can vary.
And this is an important thing
because I would like to sensibilize people
to go out from clusters and to shower,
take a look at the data in much more detail.
Many people need to understand what's mean a cluster.
Our cells like are probably much more apoptotic
than what's because markers even are difficult
to define cell types mostly.
In the single cell atlas,
the information coming from different cell types
and tissues is even very heterogeneous.
And for this reason,
I think that to shower UMAPs
and to over-interpretate this basal cluster
is always a mistake researchers are doing.
Thank you very much for this explanation.
Very interesting with this,
and we are slightly over time.
And I would like to thank you again, Gabriella,
for giving this really nice overview,
both on the technical aspect
and particularly I think important for fragile cells
and for large cells.
I think it's a really, really important contribution here
and really important insights,
but also in all the other aspects that you mentioned,
really interesting presentation.
I would like to remind you that in case you missed something
and this session is recorded,
so you can basically rewatch it
if you're interested in specific details
that you may have missed.
I would also like to remind you that in two weeks,
we have another SCOP meeting or SCOP presentation
by Dr. Tashibana from Munich,
the 1st of July, same time as today, 9.30.
And with this, yeah, thanks again, Gabriella,
for this nice presentation.
And I wish you all a great Friday
and a nice weekend ahead of you.
