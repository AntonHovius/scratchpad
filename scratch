Abstract

This review explores the evolving understanding of species in the post-genome era, focusing on the Culicid family (Diptera: Culicidae). The traditional biological species concept, which viewed interspecies hybridization as a rarity, is challenged by the influx of genomic data revealing widespread hybridization and cryptic species complexes. This has profound implications for our understanding of species and evolution, particularly in economically and medically significant species like mosquitoes. The review delves into the role of hybridization, introgression, and gene flow in vector dynamics, and the challenges to historic assumptions posed by advancements in genome sequencing. The potential of structural genomic variation in explaining complex phylogenetic relationships is also discussed and the practical implications of studying hybridization for managing a number of disease-carrying mosquito genera is highlighted.

Introduction

The biological species concept presupposed that interspecies hybridization was a rare or incidental occurrence, and so regarded observations in hybrid offspring of sterility, or an inability to develop, as conclusive evidence that its parents were indeed different species [1]. Through this lens of species, it was theorised that the risk of reduced fitness due to hybrid unviability or poor adaptation to parental niche environments, far outweighed any possible benefit that interspecies mating might confer, especially for females [2].This produced the theory of reinforcement – which suggested that selection against hybridization would inevitably drive evolution of prezygotic reproductive barriers in females [3]. We now understand this to be a gross oversimplification, but the historic misapprehension continues to cast a long shadow over contemporary discourse on hybridisation. 

The huge influx of genomic data in the last two decades has revealed many overlooked cryptic species complexes, and shown that interspecies hybridization is far more common than ever was assumed [4]. Implications of this for our concepts of species and evolution are self-evident, but these realisations carry practical consequences for how we work with monitored groups of economic and medically significant species. In an increasingly globalized and warming world [5], [6], a nuanced understanding of hybridisation is essential for actionable discussion and research [7]. I can think of no better taxon with which to demonstrate this, than mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); and with many Culicid genera made complicit by disease-causing organisms in enormous socio-economic harm globally, they have become one of the best-studied dipteran groups [8]. 

Hybridization, Introgression, and Geneflow In Culicids

Mosquito identification still relies primarily on morphology and dichotomous keys for species determination - an approach that is not only time‐consuming, but has long struggled with the high degree of taxonomic ambiguity found within culicid genera [9]. Simple mtDNA barcoding for species delineation remains a common method by which phylogeny is delineated [10], in spite of an ever-growing body of work highlighting the insufficiency of the approach [8], [11]. Research is still conducted among heated debates on the evolution and sometimes even the existence of novel genotypes/ecotypes within these vector-competent genera [12]. Anopheles funestus for example shares much of it mtDNA with its sister species. This is likely a result of introgression and significantly impedes species identification via this molecular marker. Considering the significance of the Ae funestus complex in malaria transmission, the vectoring potential of these sibling species remains woefully understudied [13], [14]. 
 
Introgression, geneflow, and hybridization are all understood to effect vector dynamics [15], and Cx. quinquefasciatus, provides a compelling model for this. As a member of the contentious Cx. pipiens species complex, Cx. quinquefasciatus hybridizes readily with its sister species wherever their ranges overlap [16]. In North America, this hybridization with Cx. p. pippiens, provides an avenue for the evolution of many novel genotypes/ecotypes that enable a degree of adult overwintering diapause in Cx. quinquefasciatus, that escalates their pestiferous traits, and offsets gradiential range limitations presented by the harsher northern winters [17]. In Asia, considerable evidence of genetic introgression is theorised to merge the human-biting habit of Cx. quinquefasciatus, with the vectorial competency of Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. pip pallens to transmit the West Nile virus [18]. Similar concerns exist in Europe where the two ecotypes Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. molestus hybridise, and though genomic evidence suggests that they have undergone incipient ecological speciation, there is still genetic hallmarks of ongoing introgression [19].

While these examples may imply an evolutionary advantage to hybridization, the reality is often more complex, with a blend of beneficial and harmful effects and intricate reproductive barriers that defy simple phylogenetic categorization [8]. There appears to be a close association in some Culicid groups between higher genetic diversity and population variability in insecticide-free regions [20]. It is suggested that is comes from a lack of selective pressure acting on hybrids, and that the fitness trade-offs associated with insecticide-resistance loci are selectively screened out of the mating populations. This however appears to be a slow and highly unpredictable process [21].

A fascinating study actively tracked hybridization between Aedes mariae and a sister species Aedes zammitii in an artificial sympatric population over 25 years [22]. Both species display interesting characteristics: post-mating reproductive isolation and partial premating isolation. Both traits were initially theorised likely candidate traits for amplification by natural selection against hybridization, but complete reproductive isolation was not reached inside the 25 year timeframe. The likelihood of reinforcing selection leading to reproductive isolation is ultimately highly dependent on the mechanisms causing prezygotic isolation [23]. So where a large modifier mutation could eliminates hybrid mating completely and give rise to reproductive isolation, other weak modifiers may only partially supress mating, and so do not entirely eliminate gene flow.

The complexity of gene flow is also embodied by an aspect of cross mating between Ae. cretinus and Ae. albopictus in its pronounced asymmetrical pattern [24]. Ae. cretinus males infrequently mate with Ae. albopictus females in laboratory experiments. This asymmetry could potentially stem from several factors pertinent to Aedes interspecific mating, including genital incompatibilities, males' variable reactions to females’ flight sounds, and the production and recognition of semiochemicals.

Advances in Genome Sequencing

The benefits of molecular data in understanding gene flow are unquestionable, but it's crucial to recognize the varying quality among all data and published genomes. The latest advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have made contemporary genomes distinct, particularly with regarding to the number and length of contigs, as well as the overall integrity and completeness of assembled genomes. A genome sequenced exclusively using short-read sequencing, devoid of additional context from other techniques such as Hi-C or optical mapping, can yield a disjointed final genome [25]. Furthermore, if the original genomic placement of tens to hundreds-of-thousands of contigs is unknown, then these assemblies are prone to substantial gaps and ambiguous regions due to DNA repetitions. This limitation seriously hinders our ability to detect significant structural genomic alterations, mainly because determining the orientation of short contigs with respect to the original genome and assessing copy number variation is nearly impossible when handling short fragments. However, these major structural shifts can have significant influences on the phenotype expressed by the organism.

Illumina's second-generation genome sequencing technology, which employs a sequencing-by-synthesis method, was susceptible to the shortcomings outlined above. Despite its economic efficiency and precision, this approach fragments DNA and achieves read lengths shorter than 300bp. The enormous computational requirement to align the potentially billions of short reads into more extensive contigs, often fails to generate chromosome-sized contigs [26].

Third-generation sequencing approaches, such as those offered by such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, sequence significantly larger DNA fragments (15 kbp to 1 Mbp) through single-molecule sequencing; which lightens the computational load of read assembly considerably and can produce contigs comparable to the size of some complete chromosomes. Despite early accuracy issues due to a high noise-to-signal ratio, revisions over the last decade have successfully addressed this problem, by allowing single DNA molecules to be sequenced multiple times in their process. 

In Pacific Biosciences' HiFi sequencing, this is achieved with extensive DNA fragments (10–25 kbp) being circularized and attached to a DNA polymerase, which facilitating repeated sequencing and produces a consensus sequence derived from the multiple sequences of this single DNA molecule. The accuracy of this approach is already comparable to that of second-generation sequencing. But perhaps the most remarkable stride in sequencing technology was achieved with the introduction of the Q20+ sequencing kits and R10.4 flow cells by Oxford Nanopore late last year. The latest version of their proprietary nanopore sequencing technology can now amalgamate and read both strands of DNA into a single basecall and produce read lengths that varying from 50 kbp all the way up to 260 kbp. This not only boosts single-molecule precision but also allows the creation of reference-quality genomes more economically than all previous methods. This innovation has spurred a dramatic shift in the examination of genomic structural differences in non-model organisms like mosquitoes. The raw signal data is also preserved, so as analytical tools have advanced alongside the platform [27] and as computational efficiency climbs, base calling can be repeated with raw data acquired from earlier flow cell revisions, enabling additional insights into methylation patterns [28] and higher fidelity base-calling despite the intrinsic limitations of earlier revisions [29]. These innovations have spurred a dramatic shift in the examination of genomic structural differences in nonmodel organisms. It also offers insights into the occurrence rate of changes in genomic architecture and their connections with reproductive barriers and hybridization, and many existing genome references can be cost-effectively amended by supplementing the ever growing in silico resource that exists in genetic databases [30].

Teasing Species Apart

Structural genomic variation, once overlooked is now increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to the standing variation that guides evolution. This understanding redefines our former belief, which held single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gradually accrued, as the predominant source of genetic variation within and among species - the primary substrate for evolutionary selection [31]. Indeed, while SNP data still hold a valuable role in unraveling species complexities and decoding phylogenetic relationships, it's this structural variation that could be key in explaining why many phylogenetic relationships defy resolution into entirely bifurcating trees [32].

Both coding and noncoding sections of the genome, inclusive of repetitive elements like transposons, may undergo structural genomic variation marked by changes in DNA composition, order, orientation, and copy number. The significant impacts of such variation extend to the phenotypes of populations and species, with associations noted between adaptive traits and structural variants. Insecticide resistance in numerous species has been linked with copy number variation. This phenomenon is observed in populations of the Yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, where there's a correlation between the copy number variation of their detoxification genes and resistance to insecticides [33], [34]. The ability to form viable hybrid zygotes is influenced by gametic compatibility, which in turn shapes gene flow at the intra and inter-species level. For instance, an inversion polymorphism introgression in Anopheles gambiae was shown to regulate gene flow: promoting it between some species pairs, while preventing it between others [35]. 

Similar to the role of morphological reproductive incompatibility, chromosome structural variations could represent an additional barrier to gene flow, although not universally across all species combinations [36], [37]. By comparing gene order or genomic structures among genomes - a process known as synteny - shared structural variations can be detected, shedding light on the historical gene flow events. This invaluable information can refine our understanding of species boundaries and create phylogenetic trees that reflect historical gene flow.

Where to From Here?

There are still many unresolved issues in our understanding of hybridization and gene flow in Culicids - particularly in the transmission and perpetuation of adaptive alleles between distinct populations and species boundaries. Initially, the process of introgression can prove challenging to uphold these adaptive alleles, as genetic drift and recombination might cleanse and eliminate these infrequent alleles. Nevertheless, if these adaptive alleles are closely packed in areas of minimal recombination, they are often preserved.

The cost-effectiveness of single-molecule sequencing, is poised to catalyze the proliferation of reference-quality genomes from diverse species and populations which will likely enable pan-genomic studies of unprecedented scope [38]. Pan-genomes encapsulate the full spectrum of a species' genetic diversity, including a foundational set of ubiquitous genes and an auxiliary repertoire of genomic variants influencing evolution and phenotypic variation. The data could enable us to discern the location, abundance, and orientation of adaptive alleles across diverse species and populations. In turn, this may unveil the evolutionary forces at work on these genes and the mechanisms that ensure the survival of these adaptive alleles amidst recombination and genetic drift. 

It may be that the introgression rates we are estimating from tree topologies severely underestimate the true amount of geneflow occurring in nature with signals only representing a small fraction of the genes at play [39], [40]. Additionally, the genome's three-dimensional structure [41], demonstrated as a key diversification factor in Anopheles mosquitoes, deserves attention [42]. While the link between chromosome conformation and gene regulation is ambiguous, chromatin domain disruption and boundary changes could cause gene misexpression, impacting fitness and paving the way for fascinating research directions. 

Conclusion

For a long time, interspecies hybridization as a conduit for gene flow was considered an occasional, taxon-bound aberration rather than a key evolutionary driver [43]. The emergence of sophisticated DNA sequencing technologies has turned this understanding on its head. It's allowing us to discover the omnipresence of gene flow in evolutionary progression, dissect the functionality of hybrid genomes, understand their broader evolutionary ramifications, and determine the regularity of this pattern. This newfound comprehension of species boundaries and adaptive evolution—heightened by the contemporary urgencies of climate change and globalization that are simultaneously connecting and segregating diverse biotas in novel ways—is incredibly pertinent [44], [45]. Additionally, studying hybridization has direct implications, aiding us in managing the risk associated with disease-carrying mosquitoes, and enhancing our understanding of their rapid adaptation and invasiveness [46].
