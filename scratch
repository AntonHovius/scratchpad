Introduction

The biological species concept presupposed that interspecies hybridization was a rare or incidental occurrence, and so regarded observations in hybrid offspring of sterility, or an inability to develop, as conclusive evidence that its parents were indeed different species [1]. Through this lens of species, it was theorised that the risk of reduced fitness due to hybrid unviability or poor adaptation to parental niche environments, far outweighed any possible benefit that interspecies mating might confer, especially for females [2].This produced the theory of reinforcement – which suggested that selection against hybridization would inevitably drive evolution of prezygotic reproductive barriers in females [3]. We now understand this to be a gross oversimplification, but the historic misapprehension continues to cast a long shadow over contemporary discourse on hybridisation. 

The huge influx of genomic data in the last two decades has revealed many overlooked cryptic species complexes, and shown that interspecies hybridization is far more common than ever was assumed [4]. Implications of this for our concepts of species and evolution are self-evident, but these realisations carry practical consequences for how we work with monitored groups of economic and medically significant species. In an increasingly globalized and warming world [5], [6], a nuanced understanding of hybridisation is essential for actionable discussion and research [7]. I can think of no better taxon with which to demonstrate this, than mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); and with many Culicid genera made complicit by disease-causing organisms in enormous socio-economic harm globally, they have become one of the best-studied dipteran groups [8]. 

Hybridization, Introgression, and Geneflow In Culicids

Mosquito identification still relies primarily on morphology and dichotomous keys for species determination - an approach that is not only time‐consuming, but has long struggled with the high degree of taxonomic ambiguity found within culicid genera [9]. Simple mtDNA barcoding for species delineation remains a common method by which phylogeny is delineated [10], in spite of an ever-growing body of work highlighting the insufficiency of the approach [8], [11]. Research is still conducted among heated debates on the evolution and sometimes even the existence of novel genotypes/ecotypes within these vector-competent genera [12]. Anopheles funestus for example shares much of it mtDNA with its sister species. This is likely a result of introgression and significantly impedes species identification via this molecular marker. Despite the importance of the Ae funestus complex in malaria transmission, the vectoring potential of these sibling species remains woefully understudied [13], [14]. 
 
Introgression, geneflow, and hybridization are all understood to effect vector dynamics [15], and Cx. quinquefasciatus, provides a compelling model for this. As a member of the contentious Cx. pipiens species complex, Cx. quinquefasciatus hybridizes readily with its sister species wherever their ranges overlap [16]. In North America, this hybridization with Cx. p. pippiens, provides an avenue for the evolution of many novel genotypes/ecotypes that enable a degree of adult overwintering diapause in Cx. quinquefasciatus, that escalates their pestiferous traits, and offsets gradiential range limitations presented by the harsher northern winters [17]. In Asia, considerable evidence of genetic introgression is theorised to merge the human-biting habit of Cx. quinquefasciatus, with the vectorial competency of Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. pip pallens to transmit the West Nile virus [18]. Similar concerns exist in Europe where the two ecotypes Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. molestus hybridise, and though genomic evidence suggests that they have undergone incipient ecological speciation, there is still genetic hallmarks of ongoing introgression [19].

While these examples may imply an evolutionary advantage to hybridization, the reality is often more complex, with a blend of beneficial and harmful effects and intricate reproductive barriers that defy simple phylogenetic categorization [Phylogenomics]. There appears to be a close association in some Culicid groups between higher genetic diversity and population variability in insecticide-free regions [20]. It is suggested that is comes from a lack of selective pressure acting on hybrids, and that the fitness trade-offs associated with insecticide-resistance loci are selectively screened out of the mating populations. This however appears to be a slow and highly unpredictable process [21].

A fascinating study actively tracked hybridization between Aedes mariae and a sister species Aedes zammitii in an artificial sympatric population over 25 years [22]. Both species display interesting characteristics: post-mating reproductive isolation (wherein the F1 males are sterile) and partial premating isolation, with mating swarms occurring at different elevations. Both traits were initially theorised likely candidate traits for amplification by natural selection against hybridization, but complete reproductive isolation was not reached inside the 25 year timeframe. The likelihood of reinforcing selection leading to reproductive isolation is ultimately highly dependent on the mechanisms causing prezygotic isolation [23]. So where one mutation that completely eliminates hybrid mating (a large modifier) may lead to complete reproductive isolation between hybridizing populations, weak modifiers merely limit, and do not entirely negate gene flow.

The complexity of gene flow is also embodied by an aspect of cross mating between Ae. cretinus and Ae. albopictus in its pronounced asymmetrical pattern [24]. Ae. cretinus males infrequently mate with Ae. albopictus females under laboratory conditions. This asymmetry could potentially stem from several factors pertinent to Aedes interspecific mating, including genital incompatibilities, males' variable reactions to females’ flight sounds, and the production and recognition of semiochemicals.

Advances in Genome Sequencing

Though the value of molecular data in shedding light on gene flow is undeniable, it's important to note that not all data, or indeed, all published genomes, carry equal weight. 'Genomic' data has been forming the bedrock of many studies for decades, but with recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, contemporary genomes have shown clear distinction. Standing out both in terms of the count and length of contigs and the overall completeness of assembled genomes.

Illumina's second-generation genome sequencing technology, utilizes a sequencing-by-synthesis method. It fragments DNA and sequences the end points, yielding read lengths >300bp. Despite its cost-effectiveness and accuracy, this approach is hindered by the short-read length and the hefty computational power required to align the potentially billions of short reads into larger contigs, often resulting in a failure to create chromosome-sized contigs.

A genome sequenced solely with short-read sequencing, without the added context from other methods such as chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) or optical mapping, can lead to a fragmented representation. If tens to hundreds-of-thousands of contigs whose original genomic placement is unknown, assemblies will likely be interspersed with considerable gaps and regions of high ambiguity due to DNA repetitiveness. This greatly hampers our ability to identify substantial structural genomic changes. The reason being, determining the orientation of short contigs relative to the original genome and assessing copy number variation becomes a Sisyphean task when dealing with short fragments. Yet, these significant structural alterations can dramatically affect the phenotype expressed by the individual.

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore systems exemplify third-generation sequencing strategies that sequence large DNA fragments (15 kbp to 1 Mbp) using single-molecule sequencing. This reduces the computational intensity of read assembly and can produce contigs up to a chromosome's size. These technologies initially suffered from low accuracy due to a high noise-to-signal ratio; however, this issue has been circumvented with modern methods that allow a single DNA molecule to be sequenced multiple times. In Pacific Biosciences' HiFi sequencing, large DNA fragments (10–25 kbp) are circularized and bound to a DNA polymerase, enabling repetitive sequencing (> 3 times). A consensus sequence is drawn from the multiple sequences of the single DNA molecule delivering on par with second-generation sequencing.

But perhaps the most remarkable leap forward in sequencing technology came out of Oxford Nanopore late last year with their Q20+ sequencing kits and R10.4 flow cells. Nanopore sequencing is now capable of generating duplex reads that sequence DNA from both strands into a single basecall, boosting single-molecule accuracy,  and producing read lengths from 50 kbp to 260 kbp. This enables the construction of reference-quality genomes at a fraction of the cost of earlier methods, and has catalyzed a profound change in the exploration of structural genomic differences in nonmodel organisms. Moreover, it has made it possible to analyze the frequency of genomic architecture alterations and their relationships with reproductive barriers and hybridization.

Teasing Species Apart

Structural genomic variation, once overlooked is now increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to the standing variation that guides evolution. This understanding redefines our former belief, which held single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gradually accrued, as the predominant source of genetic variation within and among species - the primary substrate for evolutionary selection [25]. Indeed, while SNP data still hold a valuable role in unraveling species complexities and decoding phylogenetic relationships, it's this structural variation that could be key in explaining why many phylogenetic relationships defy resolution into entirely bifurcating trees [26].

Both coding and noncoding sections of the genome, inclusive of repetitive elements like transposons, may undergo structural genomic variation marked by changes in DNA composition, order, orientation, and copy number. The significant impacts of such variation extend to the phenotypes of populations and species, with associations noted between adaptive traits and structural variants. Insecticide resistance in numerous species has been linked with copy number variation. This phenomenon is observed in populations of the Yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, where there's a correlation between the copy number variation of their detoxification genes and resistance to insecticides [27], [28]. The ability to form viable hybrid zygotes is influenced by gametic compatibility, which in turn shapes gene flow at the intra and inter-species level. For instance, an inversion polymorphism introgression in Anopheles gambiae was shown to regulate gene flow: promoting it between some species pairs, while preventing it between others [29]. 

Similar to the role of morphological reproductive incompatibility, chromosome structural variations could represent an additional barrier to gene flow, although not universally across all species combinations [30], [31]. By comparing gene order or genomic structures among genomes - a process known as synteny - shared structural variations can be detected, shedding light on the historical gene flow events. This invaluable information can refine our understanding of species boundaries and create phylogenetic trees that reflect historical gene flow.

Where to From Here?

There are still many unresolved issues in our understanding of hybridization and gene flow in Culicids - particularly in the transmission and perpetuation of adaptive alleles between distinct populations and species boundaries. Initially, the process of introgression can prove challenging to uphold these adaptive alleles, as genetic drift and recombination might cleanse and eliminate these infrequent alleles. Nevertheless, if these adaptive alleles are closely packed in areas of minimal recombination, they are often preserved.

The cost-effectiveness of single-molecule sequencing, is poised to catalyze the proliferation of reference-quality genomes from diverse species and populations which will likely enable pan-genomic studies of unprecedented scope [32]. Pan-genomes encapsulate the full spectrum of a species' genetic diversity, including a foundational set of ubiquitous genes and an auxiliary repertoire of genomic variants influencing evolution and phenotypic variation. The data could enable us to discern the location, abundance, and orientation of adaptive alleles across diverse species and populations. In turn, this may unveil the evolutionary forces at work on these genes and the mechanisms that ensure the survival of these adaptive alleles amidst recombination and genetic drift. 

It may be that the introgression rates we are estimating from tree topologies severely underestimate the true amount of geneflow occurring in nature with signals only representing a small fraction of the genes at play [33], [34]. Additionally, the genome's three-dimensional structure [35], demonstrated as a key diversification factor in Anopheles mosquitoes, deserves attention [36]. While the link between chromosome conformation and gene regulation is ambiguous, chromatin domain disruption and boundary changes could cause gene misexpression, impacting fitness and paving the way for fascinating research directions. 

Conclusion

Gene flow through interspecies hybridization is a long-recognized concept, it was previously viewed as a scarce, somewhat anomalous occurrence, limited to specific taxa and negligible as an evolutionary driving force [37]. However, with the advent of advanced DNA sequencing technologies, we are beginning to unravel not only the pervasive presence of gene flow in the evolutionary tree, but also the functional mechanisms of hybrid genomes, their broader evolutionary implications, and the frequency of this evolutionary pattern. These technological advancements pave the way towards a revised comprehension of species boundaries and the adaptive evolution of species - a matter of increasing relevance in the face of accelerating global change, particularly due to climate change and globalization which simultaneously isolates and links disparate biotas in unprecedented ways [38], [39]. Lastly, studying hybridization has practical implications beyond understanding evolutionary dynamics; it can help inform our risk management of disease-carrying mosquito - shedding light on their rapid adaptation, and escalating invasiveness [40].
